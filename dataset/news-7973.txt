For Senator Bernie Sanders, there are not just two Americas, there are at least nine.

That is, there are currently nine versions of his “America” ad, the emotional and soaring 60-second commercial set to Simon and Garfunkel’s 1968 song of the same name. The campaign produced different versions for Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Nevada, Rhode Island, east and west Pennsylvania and New York, along with a national version to run on cable, reworking it with different footage that seems more rooted in each state.

Above, we’ve collected six of the nine “America” ads as they exist now. Watching them together shows how they have been adapted to reach different audiences.

It is a practice most presidential campaigns follow. The ads that get new life with images tailored to a specific place — or a new call to action — are often the ones the campaigns believe to be most effective. Indeed, one way to tell which advertisements the campaigns believe are moving voters are the ones that they recut, revise and re-air in each state.

Senator Ted Cruz’s campaign has revised at least three of its ads, from its 60-second “Washington Deals” ad that served as part of its closing argument in Iowa, to “Chance,” an ad criticizing Donald J. Trump’s shifting positions on abortion. After the ad presented its charges against Mr. Trump, the narrator makes a statement specific to the state, like, “Arkansas cannot trust Donald Trump.”

With at least nine versions of “America” cut already, a seemingly endless supply of cash from his small-dollar donor base and a pledge to stay in the race for the time being, there’s a good chance the campaign will be “counting the cars on the New Jersey turnpike” ahead of that state’s primary in June.
