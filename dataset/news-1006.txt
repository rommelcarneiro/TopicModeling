Poland will play Switzerland in the round of 16 with a big question hanging over its head: Has the star striker Robert Lewandowski left his goal-scoring boots at home?

Poland cemented its first appearance in the European Championships’ knockout stage by defeating Ukraine, 1-0, in a Group C match in Marseille, France.

But Lewandowski, who is usually so clinical for Bayern Munich and was the top scorer in Euro 2016 qualifying with 13 goals, finished group play not only having failed to find the net in three matches but also having failed to record a single shot on target.

The second-half substitute Jakub Blaszczykowski struck the winner in the 54th minute for Poland, which finished second in the group behind Germany. Both had 7 points, but Germany had a superior goal difference. Ukraine entered the game already eliminated from contention.

Lewandowski squandered several chances, missing a sitter in the first half, failing to connect with a cross and tripping himself up while in front of the goal. Coach Adam Nawalka insisted that he was not concerned, predicting that Lewandowski would score against Switzerland on Saturday in St.-Étienne. (AP)
