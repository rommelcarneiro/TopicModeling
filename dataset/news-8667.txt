Newly inducted Rock and Roll Hall of Fame member Ice Cube will headline the 2016 Afropunk Festival, coming to Brooklyn on Aug. 27-28. Janelle Monáe, Tyler the Creator, CeeLo Green and George Clinton are also scheduled to perform at the event, which has announced its theme this year will be “Power to the Party.”

The Afropunk Festival, now in its 12th year, is a celebration of the many facets of black culture, and in recent years has turned into something of a fashion show. This year, the festival will stay true to its punk roots with a superjam that features members from Bad Brains, Fishbone and Living Colour. Other performers include the rappers Earl Sweatshirt, Young Fathers and Angel Haze; the bands TV on the Radio and the Internet; and the producers Flying Lotus and Sango.

The festival will take place at Commodore Barry Park in Fort Greene; more information and a full lineup can be found at afropunk.com.
