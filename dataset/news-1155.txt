This week on the music charts, Drake rules once again while the “Hamilton” album rides its Tony Award victories to a new high.

Drake’s “Views” (Young Money/Cash Money/Republic) had just 27,000 album sales in the United States last week, but its 110 million streams were far ahead of those for any other record, according to data from Nielsen. “Views” stays at No. 1 for a seventh week, tying the most recent run by Adele’s “25” in late 2015 and early 2016. (Among other long stretches at No. 1 recently, the “Frozen” soundtrack notched eight consecutive straight weeks in 2014, and Adele’s “21” had 10 in a row two years before.)

Nick Jonas’s latest solo album, “Last Year Was Complicated” (Island), opened at No. 2, while the cast recording for “Hamilton” (Atlantic) rises 10 spots to a peak of No. 3. According to Billboard, “Hamilton” has become one of only three Broadway cast recordings to reach the Top 10 in the last 50 years, and is the highest-charting such album in five years, since “The Book of Mormon” also hit No. 3. On June 12, “Hamilton” won 11 Tony Awards, including best musical.

Also this week, Beyoncé’s “Lemonade” (Parkwood/Columbia) is No. 4, and the Long Island-born singer Jon Bellion, who sang on Zedd’s dance hit “Beautiful Now” last year, opens at No. 5 with his new solo album, “The Human Condition” (Capitol).
