The Tribeca Film Festival wrapped up on Sunday, and announced its Audience Award winners: “Here Alone,” directed by Rod Blackhurst, and “The Return,” directed by Kelly Duane de la Vega and Katie Galloway.

The winners were chosen through online audience voting. “Here Alone,” which won the Narrative Award, depicts an apocalyptic civilization ravaged by a virus. “The Return” won the Documentary Award and focuses on the struggles of convicts re-entering society. Each award came with a cash prize of $10,000.

The runners-up were “Children of the Mountain,” set in Ghana, about a mother facing adversity, which was written and directed by Priscilla Anany; and “Midsummer in Newtown,” a documentary directed by Lloyd Kramer about a production of “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” starring local children in Newtown, Conn.
