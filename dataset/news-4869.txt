For the first time in weeks, the most significant news story dominating the cable networks on Thursday was unrelated to the presidential campaign: the disappearance of EgyptAir Flight 804.

But Hillary Clinton broke through the cable din for an interview on CNN, a day after Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, used the word “rape” to conjure old accusations made against her husband.

Mrs. Clinton made clear she was not going to join that battle. Instead, she said, voters want to know what the candidates will do for their futures, a bit of a riff on one of her husband’s lines from his 1992 presidential campaign, when his infidelities were raised, about his rivals wanting to focus on the past.

Mrs. Clinton also made her most vocal case against Mr. Trump, saying he is unqualified for the Oval Office, and declared her Democratic primary race against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont all but settled.

The former secretary of state is not prone to the staccato-style series of phone and sit-down interviews that Mr. Trump favors, and she has a long way to go to frame a message against him between now and November. Whether the interview signals a new approach remains to be seen.

As for Mr. Trump, he stayed off the campaign trail on Thursday, although he promoted Paul J. Manafort to chief strategist, the highest position one can hold on a campaign. On Friday, Mr. Trump will be in Kentucky, appearing at a National Rifle Association conference.
