The shooting at a T.I. concert at Irving Plaza on May 25 — which resulted in the arrest of the rapper Troy Ave on attempted murder charges and the death of his associate Ronald McPhatter — has had a dispiritingly familiar fallout. William J. Bratton, the police commissioner, referred to rappers as “thugs,” and Live Nation postponed a spate of rap concerts scheduled to take place in the same venue this week.

But, with a few notable exceptions, hip-hop shows in New York over the last decade have been extremely safe, a byproduct of sea changes in the music and also in the way the genre has been policed (both externally and internally).

Nevertheless, the public discourse following this latest incident has recalled the debates of an earlier era, the mid-to-late 1990s, the beginning of hip-hop’s true new-money era, a time when New York hip-hop concerts and clubs were far woollier, and the policing of them was unusually aggressive.

To discuss the then and now of hip-hop night life surveillance on this week’s Popcast, I was joined by New York Times pop music reporter Joe Coscarelli; Minya Oh, the longtime hip-hop journalist and proprietor of the news site MissInfo.tv; and Joie Manda, president of urban music at Interscope Records, and also a key figure in 1990s New York hip-hop night life, having worked at influential clubs including the Palladium and the Tunnel.
