MOSCOW — Russian prosecutors said in a statement on Thursday that they would investigate reports that the country’s athletes doped at three recent Olympics.

The prosecutors will request information from authorities in the United States, from other unspecified countries and from the World Anti-Doping Agency. Other Russian law enforcement agencies will also participate in the inquiry, the statement said.

Over the last six months, Russia has been accused of running a pervasive state-sponsored doping program.

In November, a report published by WADA accused Russia of running a systematic doping scheme.

Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, who was identified as a linchpin in the program, told The New York Times in an article last week that he ran an elaborate doping program during the 2014 Sochi Games. The scheme involved at least 15 medal winners, he said.

With the help of Russian intelligence service agents, the athletes’ urine samples were stealthily replaced with clean urine in the middle of the night, Dr. Rodchenkov said.

Russia denied it had operated any state-sponsored doping scheme in Sochi. President Vladimir V. Putin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, told reporters that Dr. Rodchenkov’s accusations look like “slander by a turncoat.”

The United States Justice Department opened its own inquiry into state-sponsored doping in Russia, two people familiar with the case said on Tuesday.

Russia’s track and field team is currently facing the prospect of being barred from competing in the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, which begin on Aug. 5.

Writing in The Sunday Times, a British newspaper, on Sunday, Russia’s sports minister, Vitaly Mutko, acknowledged that the country had made “serious mistakes,” and asked that its athletes be allowed to compete at the coming Games.

In January, Russian prosecutors also said that they would check accusations listed in the WADA report, but the inquiry resulted in no criminal charges.
