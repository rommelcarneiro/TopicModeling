Rachel Ann Nordlinger, the daughter of Margaret M. Nordlinger and Douglas E. Nordlinger of Key Biscayne, Fla., was married June 18 to Andrew Chase Langer, a son of Bobbi A. Langer and Bruce A. Langer of New York. Rabbi Joshua M. Davidson performed the ceremony at Temple Emanu-El in New York.

Mrs. Langer, 29, is an associate in the private banking division of JPMorgan Chase in New York, where she specializes in making investments for families. She graduated from Duke, and received a master’s degree in education from Bank Street College of Education and an M.B.A. from Northwestern.

Her father retired as a partner in the London office of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, the New York law firm. Her mother retired as a vice president in the commercial real estate division of the former Riggs National Bank in Washington.

Mr. Langer, 29, is pursuing an M.B.A. at Columbia. He graduated from Johns Hopkins and received a master’s degree in international security studies from the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.

His parents, both lawyers, work for New York firms — his mother as an associate in the real estate group at Schulte Roth & Zabel, and his father as a partner in McLaughlin & Stern.

The couple met in July 2013 on a blind date arranged by a mutual friend.
