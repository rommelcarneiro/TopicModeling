SAN DIEGO — Colin Rea lost his no-hit bid with two outs in the seventh inning and finished with eight-plus innings of three-hit ball as the San Diego Padres beat the Mets, 5-3, on Thursday night.

The Padres remain the only team in the major leagues without a no-hitter, having failed to achieve the milestone in 7,519 games since 1969.

Rea (3-1) had retired 19 straight batters until Yoenis Cespedes grounded a single through the right side where the second baseman normally would have been. The no-hit bid was extended several times by the shift.

The Mets’ only baserunner up to that point had been David Wright, who walked with one out in the first.

Rea’s no-hit bid was also preserved when Jon Jay made a nice sliding catch of Curtis Granderson’s fly ball on the warning track in center for the final out of the third.

Manager Andy Green let Rea go out for the ninth in an attempt to get his first complete game in 12 career starts, but Green pulled Rea after he allowed Granderson’s leadoff homer to center, his fifth. Brad Hand came on and walked David Wright before allowing Cespedes’s two-run homer with one out, his ninth.

Fernando Rodney got the final two outs for seventh save.

Rea, 25, struck out five and walked one.

Derek Norris finished a triple short of the cycle for the Padres.

Rea got enough support from the Padres’ sometimes anemic offense, which jumped on Jacob deGrom (3-1).

Wil Myers homered to straightaway center with one out in the first. Rea hit a run-scoring single in the second, and Alexei Ramirez had a run-scoring double in the third.

Logan Verrett came on to start the sixth for the Mets and surrendered Norris’s home run to left. The Padres added another run on an error.

DeGrom allowed three runs and eight hits in five innings, struck out two and walked one.
