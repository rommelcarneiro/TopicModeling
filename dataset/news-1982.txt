Microsoft on Monday unveiled a smaller, less expensive Xbox One and plans for a new console that can offer virtual reality games as it seeks to catch up with Sony in video game hardware.

The new Xbox One S starts at $300 and costs up to $400 for a 2-terabyte hard drive; the Xbox One previously started at $349. The new device supports 4K video and is about 40 percent smaller than the original model. A special edition will be available in August and standard versions will come out later this year.

Microsoft also revealed a product called Project Scorpio, a console with high-fidelity virtual reality that will be available by the end of next year. The announcements were made at E3, the Electronic Entertainment Expo, a video game trade show held annually in Los Angeles.

Microsoft is competing fiercely against Sony in the console market, which has lost some of its shine as new forms of play — such as mobile games — come to the fore, but which remains a lucrative area with a dedicated demographic of hard-core gamers. Sony has sold about 40 million PlayStation 4s, which are its latest generation of consoles, with Microsoft estimated to have sold about 21 million Xbox One consoles, according to SuperData Research.

The console makers are also trying to keep ahead of technology trends, with virtual reality regarded as a promising direction. Facebook, HTC and others have released virtual reality headsets and an early use of the technology is for games. Sony has already announced a virtual reality headset that will work with its PlayStation 4 console.

Monday’s Xbox announcements are Microsoft’s attempt “to catch up” with Sony, said Joost van Dreunen, the chief executive of SuperData Research.

In a presentation, the head of Xbox, Phil Spencer, called Project Scorpio a “serious inflection point” and said he was announcing the console months ahead of its release in order “to give our developers and partners the ability to take advantage of that capability now.”

The new machine will be the first Xbox to offer virtual reality and will most likely be more expensive, so it is unlikely to cannibalize sales from the lower-priced Xbox One, said Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities.

Microsoft also said that it expected more Xbox games to be compatible across all of its hardware products, and that many could also be played on platforms made by Apple, Google and Microsoft PC.

The company also announced new communities and groups for Xbox game players, including realms for the popular Minecraft game that allow players to collaborate whether they use Xbox, iOS, Android or PC operating systems.

“Xbox has become aware that it has to engage customers more,” Mr. van Dreunen of SuperData Research said.
