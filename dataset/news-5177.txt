Japan’s economy, the world’s third largest, expanded at the fastest pace in a year during the first quarter on stronger private consumption and exports, complicating Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s decision on whether or not to delay a planned sales tax increase next year.

The economy expanded by an annualized 1.7 percent in the first three months of the year, rebounding from a 1.7 percent contraction in the previous quarter, according to data from the Cabinet Office released on Wednesday.

Many analysts had expected the data to show that the economy had contracted for a second straight quarter — technically a recession — when excluding the increase to consumption from the extra day for the leap year. But private consumption rose 0.5 percent as households spent more on televisions, food and beverage, and recreation, the data showed.

Still, analysts say the rebound is not strong enough to dispel concerns.

“Growth is not as strong as the headline number shows,” said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.

He said he expected that the data would lead the prime minister “to delay a planned sales tax hike next year and to roll out additional fiscal stimulus worth at least 5 trillion yen.”

Japan’s economy minister, Nobuteru Ishihara, told reporters after the data was released that while the economy continues to recover moderately, the government was ready to take a “flexible policy response” to risks such as volatile markets and weak demand in emerging economies.

Foreign demand for Japanese goods also added 0.2 percentage point to gross domestic product growth, as exports gained 0.6 percent.

On a quarter-over-quarter basis, the economy grew 0.4 percent in the first three months of the year.

Government officials have said the data will be crucial in Mr. Abe’s decision about a tax increase.

The data also comes ahead of a Group of 7 leaders’ summit meeting in western Japan next week, where Mr. Abe hopes to foster agreement on the need for global coordination of policies to jump-start growth.

Japan’s economy contracted in the final quarter of last year as slow wage growth hurt private consumption, while exports felt the pinch of sluggish demand from emerging markets and the pain of a strong yen.

Mr. Abe raised the sales tax to 8 percent from 5 percent in 2014, which tipped the economy into recession. That led him to delay by 18 months a second tax increase to 10 percent.
