Germany and Poland played out the first scoreless draw of the European Championships on Thursday in a dour match at the Stade de France in St.-Denis, France.

Arkadiusz Milik, who scored Poland’s winner against Northern Ireland on Sunday, misplayed a header as he fell to his knees in Germany’s goal mouth, and the ball bounced just wide of Manuel Neuer’s right-hand post.

That error, less than 20 seconds into the second half, hinted at better things after a lifeless first period.

But neither team could sustain any attacking pressure.

At the final whistle, Adam Nawalka, Poland’s coach, turned and applauded his staff and the substitutes in the dugout.

Nawalka said his players were not happy just to have drawn with the 2014 World Cup winner.

“It just shows our ambition,” he said through an interpreter. “Every match, it looks better and better.”

Germany leads the group, and if it finishes at the top, its reward will be a game against a third-place team in the knockout rounds that its coach, Joachim Löw, already seems eager to experience.

“In knockout games,” he said, the opponents “will be more open and have to invest more in attacking.”
