The death of a 3-month-old girl who was found unconscious by officers in a Staten Island apartment last summer has been ruled a homicide, the police said on Monday.

The infant, Morgan Ricks, was found unconscious and unresponsive on Aug. 30, 2015, at an apartment on Jersey Street, part of the Richmond Terrace Houses, a New York City Housing Authority complex on the North Shore, the authorities said. Morgan was taken to Richmond University Medical Center in critical condition. The authorities said she had respiratory failure and had retinal hemorrhaging consistent with head trauma.

Morgan died of her injuries on Sept. 11, 2015. The New York City medical examiner determined last week that her death was a homicide. It was unclear what caused the delay in making the ruling, but officials have said that cases involving young children can take longer because of the complexity and the additional testing sometimes required.

The medical examiner found that Morgan died of abusive head trauma.

Morgan was among nine children 5 years old or younger who were homicide victims last year in the city, according to the police; there have been four so far this year.

No arrests have been made and the authorities did not release any information about any suspects.
