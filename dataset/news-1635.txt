LOS ANGELES — Years in the making, a screen version of the Broadway musical “Wicked” has finally been scheduled for release by Universal Pictures, for Dec. 20, 2019.

Stephen Daldry, who will direct, has flirted with the project since at least 2012, and at one point appeared poised to make a version for release this year. Hollywood has long had its eye on the show, which tells the Wizard of Oz story from the viewpoint of its witches.

The writer Winnie Holzman, who is credited with the book for “Wicked,” and its lyricist-composer Stephen Schwartz, are collaborating on a script for the film, of which Marc Platt will be a producer. Mr. Platt and Universal Stage Productions are among the producers of the long-running musical, which had its premiere in San Francisco in 2003.
