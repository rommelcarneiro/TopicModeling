Payday loans are well-known for their high interest rates and fees, but for many borrowers, they have a second, less obvious cost: the bank fees incurred when automatic loan repayments fall short.

Bank overdraft and insufficient-fund fees often add hundreds of dollars to the cost of a loan, according to a study released Wednesday by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is preparing to propose new rules for the payday loan industry.

The agency said it analyzed 18 months of transaction data from nearly 20,000 accounts showing payments to Internet-based payday lenders. Such lenders typically deposit short-term borrowed money directly into a customer’s checking account, then use the same automated system to regularly deduct payments for loans that often have interest rates of 400 percent or more.

About half of the accounts that the agency examined had one or more automated loan payment requests fail, incurring an average of $185 in bank fees over the duration of the study. Banks closed the checking accounts of more than a third of the people who had a failed payment request.

Many customers rely on automated bank withdrawals to cover recurring bills like mortgage or car payments, and the overwhelming majority of payday loan payment requests the bureau studied — 94 percent — went through without a problem.

But once a single payment request fails, it can set off a domino effect of fees and other repercussions. Payday lenders often submit multiple requests on one day, and some intentionally break them into chunks — submitting three $100 requests, for example, instead of one $300 request — in hopes that at least one will be fulfilled, the bureau found.

“Lenders that are owed money are entitled to get paid back, but we do not want lenders to be abusing their preferential access to people’s accounts,” said Richard Cordray, director of the bureau. “Borrowers should not have to bear the unexpected burdens of being hit repeatedly with steep, hidden penalty fees that are tacked on to the costs of their existing loans.”

The new study is the latest in a series of payday lending research reports that the bureau says it hopes will bolster its case for increased regulation of the industry. A preliminary set of proposals that the agency is considering, released a year ago, drew broad, fierce criticism. The payday loan industry said the proposed rules could deprive low-income Americans of a vital source of credit, while consumer advocates said the rules did not go far enough.

Republican lawmakers on the House Financial Services Committee sharply criticized the bureau’s recommendations in a hearing last month, but Mr. Cordray said he still intended to propose more complete rules within a few months.

One rule the bureau is considering would prevent creditors from repeatedly returning to a dry well by cutting them off after two consecutive unsuccessful attempts to deduct a loan payment from a borrower’s bank account. The lender would not be allowed to make any further attempts unless the borrower provided the bank with a new authorization.

Few federal rules govern overdraft and insufficient funds fees, which run around $35 per transaction at large banks. The bureau has expressed concern about the issue, but has stopped short of saying it intends to draft new rules about those fees.

Some banks say they have already acted to rein in their fees. Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo limit overdraft charges to four per account per business day, bank representatives said.

JPMorgan Chase pledged two years ago to change how it handles automatic withdrawals for payday loan payments, after a front-page article in The New York Times drew attention to the high fees some of its customers incurred.

The bank now levies only one insufficient funds fee per account per month for charges from each merchant, preventing customers from being hit with multiple payment requests from the same creditor, said Michael Fusco, a JPMorgan spokesman.
