“The Feel-Good Vote That Could Sink Britain’s Economy” by Peter S. Goodman (May 22) examined next month’s referendum in Britain on whether the nation should leave the European Union, a move sometimes termed Brexit.

The article attracted 317 comments to nytimes.com. The following have been edited and condensed.

A Brexit will only hurt the British economy if Brussels decides that it will hurt the British economy. The trade barriers that would presumably go up are entirely artificial. Any actions by the E.U. to penalize Britain if it leaves should be framed in that light.

So I’m voting and I’m genuinely undecided. There is a democratic deficit in the E.U. and they have treated the Greek economic crisis with incompetence and a lack of empathy. Ditto the migration crisis. On the other hand the loudest outers are not people I would care to spend time with and their vision for my country post-exit is the opposite of mine.

Even if there really was a likelihood of a shaky economic future, that is a price well worth paying for being out of the Soviet-style superstate that the E.U. is becoming. I’m voting to leave.

Geoff Lumley, U.K.

It’s impossible to kick the Brits out of the E.U., so the only way the E.U. can get rid of the Brits is by having them vote themselves out. I’m crossing my fingers.
