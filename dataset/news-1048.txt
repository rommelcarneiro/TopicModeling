The Metropolitan Opera will kick off its free Summer HD Festival on Aug. 26 with an outdoor showing of the Academy Award-winning film “Amadeus” on the Lincoln Center plaza, followed by 10 nights of opera screenings, including more Mozart the next night with “Le Nozze di Figaro.”

The opening night screening of “Amadeus,” which is being co-presented by the Film Society of Lincoln Center, is being dedicated to the memory of Peter Shaffer, who wrote the play that the film was based on. He died earlier this month.

Other operas being screened in this year’s festival — which will have 3,100 seats set up and does not require tickets — include Verdi’s “Il Trovatore” and “Otello”; Puccini’s “Turandot”; Bizet’s “Les Pêcheurs de Perles”; Donizetti’s “La Fille du Régiment” and “Lucia di Lammermoor”; Rossini’s “La Cenerentola”; the double bill of Mascagni’s “Cavalleria Rusticana” and Leoncavallo’s “Pagliacci”; and Lehár’s “The Merry Widow.”
