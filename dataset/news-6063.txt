NEW DELHI — A 23-year-old student died of his injuries in West Bengal early Tuesday after he was beaten by a crowd of villagers who suspected him of stealing a water buffalo, the police said.

The student, Kaushik Purokite, who was studying mechanics, was in a public square in the village of Bahadurpur Paschim Pada when a group of villagers attacked him, said Gautam Mitra, officer in charge at the Diamond Harbour police station.

The villagers suspected him of stealing a buffalo that was to be sacrificed next week in a ceremony honoring the goddess Kali, Mr. Mitra said.

Mr. Purokite pleaded with the villagers to let him go, but they accused him of trying to “sabotage their sacred sacrificial ritual to the goddess,” beating him with flashlights and their bare hands, Mr. Mitra said.

Mr. Purokite was declared dead upon arrival at a nearby hospital.

Ten villagers, including two women, have been named in the complaint filed by Mr. Purokite’s relatives and have been charged with murder. One has been arrested and four more detained for investigation, the police said.
