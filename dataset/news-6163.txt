Eric Mangan, a Time Warner spokesman, said the problem, which began in the early afternoon, had stemmed from cables managed by Level 3 Communications, a company that provides Internet infrastructure to several telecommunications companies, including Cox and Time Warner.

Mr. Mangan said that repairs at Level 3 were “well underway” and that Time Warner had restored service in New York City at 8:45 p.m.

Mr. Mangan said he did not know how many customers had been affected. He noted that broadcast television channels had not been disrupted.

Stephanie Walkenshaw, a spokeswoman for Level 3, confirmed in a statement that the company’s network was experiencing disruptions that were “affecting some of our customers with operations in the Northeastern United States due to a fiber cut caused by third-party construction.”

Shortly after 3 p.m., one of Time Warner’s Twitter accounts told its customers in New York City that the company knew about the problems and that its technicians were investigating.

The website Downdetector, which uses social-media mapping to detect service interruptions, showed that complaints about Time Warner had spiked online between 2 and 5 p.m. At the peak of the problems, around 3 p.m., Downdetector recorded close to 3,000 complaints.

Time Warner representatives responded to scores of complaints online, typically telling customers they were aware of the problem and were not sure when it would be fixed.

One representative, responding to a Manhattan customer whose cable was not working, said: “In outage situations, we are seldomly provided an E.T.A. Once the issue is resolved, your services will resume normal operation there.”
