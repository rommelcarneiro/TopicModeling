Six years ago when the chef Jesse Schenker opened his tasting-menu restaurant Recette in a West Village shoe box, such places were not the rage they have become. Now he is closing Recette and carrying its approach to the Gander, the restaurant he opened two years ago in a larger space in the Flatiron district.

“Recette will live on in the Gander’s dining room,” he said. “Many of our customers wanted the Recette experience.”

The restaurant was awarded two stars in a 2010 review in The New York Times by Sam Sifton, who called the cooking “smart and imaginative,” and “the food that results from it elegant and full of flavor.”

Mr. Schenker said the decision to close Recette was prompted by its small size and escalating rent. The restaurant could not even serve lunch, he said, because the cooks used the dining room for prep during the day.

In March, he revamped the Gander’s menus, offering an all-day menu in the bar and adding tasting-menu options in the dining room beyond, preparing for this eventual development. “Now I can do both à la carte and tastings,” he said. “I’m bringing my entire Recette staff over here.”

“Recette was not a failure,” Mr. Schenker said. “It was a steppingstone to where I am today.” He also hinted that he may have some new projects in the works.

Recette’s final dinner will be served Saturday.
