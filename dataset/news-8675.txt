United States stocks closed mostly higher on Tuesday, led by gains in energy, mining and financial companies.

The Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index eked out small gains. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index closed modestly lower, reflecting a slump in technology stocks, which were dragged down by Netflix and IBM.

The gains in energy and mining companies came as prices for oil, copper and other basic materials rose.

Investors were focused mostly on the latest batch of corporate earnings reports and on what company managers had to say about their prospects for profits this year. This week, about 100 of the companies in the S.&P. 500 are due to report quarterly results.

“The market is focused on where we are going to be three months from now, five months from now,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial. “It’s all about the guidance.”

The S.&P. 500 gained 6.46 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,100.80. The Nasdaq fell 19.69 points, or 0.4 percent, to 4,940.33.

The Dow rose 49.44 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,053.60.

Expectations for earnings over all are low this quarter, but several companies delivered results that put investors in a buying mood on Tuesday.

Johnson & Johnson gained 1.6 percent after its first-quarter earnings beat Wall Street’s expectations. Higher sales of new prescription drugs and other medicines nearly offset a big hit from the strong dollar. The stock added $1.75 to close at $112.68.

The health insurer UnitedHealth Group added 2.1 percent after it reported strong results for the first quarter and raised its guidance for the year. The company also said it would cut back on participating in Affordable Care Act health care exchanges in an effort to stem losses related to the program. The stock rose $2.69, to $130.50.

Goldman Sachs’s latest results gave its shares a lift. The investment bank’s earnings beat Wall Street’s estimates, even though its profit sank 56 percent from a year earlier. The stock rose $3.63, or 2.3 percent, to $162.65.

The railroad operator Kansas City Southern gained 4.6 percent after it posted larger-than-expected quarterly earnings. The stock climbed $4.55, to $96.02.

Some companies’ quarterly snapshots and outlooks failed to impress traders. The streaming video company Netflix slumped 13 percent a day after it offered a disappointing forecast for subscriber additions and reported first-quarter revenue that fell short of financial analysts’ forecasts. The stock lost $14.06, closing at $94.34.

IBM delivered improved first-quarter earnings thanks to a big tax refund, but also had lower revenue from weak software sales. The stock slid $8.53, or 5.6 percent, to $144.

Illumina, which makes genetic testing tools, sank 23.2 percent after it predicted that sales in the first quarter would be far lower than analysts had expected. Its shares were down $41.25, to $136.88.

Beyond earnings, the market pushed up prices for shares of mining and energy companies as the price of oil, natural gas, metals and other materials rose. Freeport-McMoRan gained 99 cents, or 9 percent, to $12.01, while Newmont Mining rose $1.45, or 4.9 percent, to $30.91.

Williams was among the energy and drilling services companies that got a lift. It jumped $1.33, or 8 percent, to $18.01, and Oneok climbed $2.23, or 6.9 percent, to $34.39. Diamond Offshore Drilling rose $1.41, or 6.3 percent, to $23.76.

Benchmark United States crude rose $1.30, or 3.3 percent, to settle at $41.08 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international benchmark, gained $1.12, or 2.6 percent, to $44.03 a barrel in London. Natural gas jumped 15 cents, or 7.6 percent, to $2.09 per 1,000 cubic feet.

The German DAX was up 2.3 percent, while the CAC 40, in France, was up 1.3 percent. The British FTSE 100 was up 0.8 percent.

In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei 225 rallied 3.7 percent after a sharp loss on Monday. The South Korean Kospi rose 0.1 percent, while the Hang Seng index, in Hong Kong, gained 1.3 percent.

In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline rose about 4 cents, or 3 percent, to close at $1.48 a gallon. Heating oil added 2 cents, or about 2 percent, to close at $1.26 a gallon.

Precious and industrial metals futures ended sharply higher. Gold rose $19.30, or 1.6 percent, to $1,254.30 an ounce; silver gained 72 cents, or 4.4 percent, to $16.97 an ounce; and copper rose 6 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $2.22 a pound.

In the bond markets, the price of the 10-year United States Treasury note fell by 4⁄32, to 9818⁄32. The yield rose to 1.79 percent from 1.77 percent.

In currency markets, the Japanese yen resumed its slide, with the dollar strengthening to 109.13 yen from 108.82 yen. The euro rose to $1.1377 from $1.1314.
