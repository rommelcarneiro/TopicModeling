“The Great British Baking Show,” the BBC series that has attained near-cult status in the United States, will premiere a third season on July 1 on PBS.

Hosted by Mary Berry, the author of more than 70 cookbooks, and the baker Paul Hollywood, “The Great British Baking Show” has aired six seasons in Britain. The most recent finale was that nation’s most-watched television show of 2015 when it was broadcast in October. PBS, which aired two previous seasons of the show, will broadcast Britain’s Season 6 in the United States and call it Season 3. Additional seasons of the series will premiere on PBS over the next two years.

What it lacks in vitriolic chefs and dramatic competitors common to American cooking competitions, “The Great British Baking Show” makes up for in earnestness and charm. A dozen amateur bakers offer pleasant backstories (and do their best to maintain stiff upper lips) while toiling over mixers and ovens in a tent at the “Downton Abbey”-esque Welford Park in Berkshire.

But the very British-sounding confections are the real stars of this Bafta-winning series. Be warned: Episode 8’s flaky, puff pastry horns, filled with rose pistachio and mocha hazelnut buttercream frostings, will make you want to lick the screen.

The first season of “The Great British Baking Show,” known as “The Great British Bake Off” in Britain, is available on Netflix and the first two seasons are available on PBS.org for PBS members.
