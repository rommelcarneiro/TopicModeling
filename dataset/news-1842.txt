A goal from Birkir Bjarnason earned Iceland a shocking 1-1 tie with Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal in St.-Étienne, France, in Iceland’s first match at a major tournament.

Iceland trailed after a first-half strike by Nani, but Bjarnason slotted home the equalizer in the 50th minute with a curled volley at the far post, moments after Ronaldo missed a chance to make the score 2-0 when he shot wide.

Nani put Portugal in front with a clinical finish from close range on a day when Ronaldo equaled Luis Figo’s Portugal record of 127 caps.

Nani turned Portugal’s early dominance of possession into a goal when he collected a cross from the right by Andre Gomes and steered the ball home at the near post in the 31st minute.

Portugal had wasted chances before then, notably in the 22nd minute when Ronaldo found Nani in the box with a precise cross. Nani’s powerful header hit the feet of keeper Hannes Halldorsson.
