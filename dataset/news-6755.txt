A man pleaded guilty on Wednesday to criminal charges in the rape and strangling of a girl in the Bronx a week before her 16th birthday, prosecutors said.

The man, Luis Vega, 38, pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter and a first-degree criminal sexual act in State Supreme Court in the Bronx for the 2012 death of the girl, Destiny Sanchez, who was the daughter of his sister’s boyfriend, prosecutors said.

Mr. Vega will be sentenced this month to 25 years in prison for the manslaughter charge and 20 years for the criminal sexual act, prosecutors said; he will serve the sentences concurrently. He will also be sentenced to 10 years of postrelease supervision and will have to register as a sex offender, prosecutors said.

His lawyer could not be reached for comment on Wednesday.

The authorities said that on Nov. 22, 2012, Destiny left her father’s home with Mr. Vega and went to an apartment building on Barretto Street in the Hunts Point neighborhood, where Mr. Vega gave her alcohol. The next morning, the authorities said, she was found unconscious in the lobby with her clothes askew and bleach poured over her body.

Mr. Vega was linked to her death by DNA evidence, prosecutors said.
