There is no earthly reason that the National Design Awards, a program of the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum, should give most of its love to New Yorkers. And yet it often does. Last year, six of the 11 winners were based in New York. But in an apparent corrective, the Gotham count is down this year: the nonprofit Center for Urban Pedagogy took the corporate and institutional prize, and Opening Ceremony (really, a global brand) won for fashion.

In other parts of the nation, the architect Moshe Safdie (Somerville, Mass.) was honored for lifetime achievement (his Yad Vashem Holocaust History Museum is pictured). Bruce Mau (Evanston, Ill.) was named “design mind.” Marlon Blackwell (Fayetteville, Ark.) took the architecture prize. Geoff McFetridge (Los Angeles) won for communication design. Tellart (Providence, R.I., and elsewhere) took interaction design.

And San Franciscans (albeit with multiple offices) swept the rest: Studio O&A for interior design, Hargreaves Associates for landscape design and Ammunition for product design.

Mariana Amatullo, a design educator who led the 2016 awards jury, confirmed that non-New Yorkness was a factor in the selection of honorees, announced Thursday, but not “the first lens.” More important, she said, were excellence and innovation.
