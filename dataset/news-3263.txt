A senior police official was stripped of his gun and badge and placed on modified duty on Thursday in connection with a broad federal inquiry into municipal corruption, the New York Police Department announced.

The official, Deputy Chief John Sprague, 45, was disciplined after he indicated that he would refuse to answer questions before a federal grand jury.

Chief Sprague, who has been at the department for 25 years, according to a police spokeswoman, had recently taken charge of the Force Investigation Division, a newly formed unit with a mission to investigate the use of deadly force by police officers.

He joins a number of other police officials who have been disciplined after refusing to answer questions in relation to the inquiry.

“On the advice of counsel, Deputy Chief Sprague has relied upon his constitutional right as a citizen of the United States,” Roy T. Richter, the president of the Captains Endowment Association, the union that represents Chief Sprague, said in a statement.

“The chief will continue to cooperate with whatever administrative process the department deems appropriate,” he added.

Chief Sprague’s lawyer, Michael Farkas, said that as “a dedicated public official who has served the people of this city for many years,” his client “intends to answer all questions put to him by the Police Department during its investigation.”

The inquiry is being led by federal authorities and conducted with the help of the department’s Internal Affairs Bureau. Its focus is two businessmen who are tied to Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, and their attempts to cultivate a network of municipal contacts, including police officials.
