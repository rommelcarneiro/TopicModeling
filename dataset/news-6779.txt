Lee Broom doesn’t present his work like a typical designer — he always puts on a show. For his first installation in New York, Mr. Broom, who is based in London, is creating a monthlong pop-up called “Broom off Broome.”

“I didn’t want to create a conventional store or showroom,” he said. “The idea is to take people on a bit of a journey. The space reveals itself as you walk through.”

The 2,000-square-foot shop in SoHo is Mr. Broom’s take on British Georgian architecture mixed with New York loft style, in his signature gray palette.

He’ll be showing about 50 pieces of furniture and decorative accessories, including new versions of his Mini Crescent light fixture (a chandelier, table lamp and desk lamp) created for this location, where everything is for sale. Prices range from $110 for a Half Cut crystal glass to $39,850 for the Shadow Cabinet sideboard.

Open May 12 to June 10 at 63 Greene Street; information: Nycxdesign.com .
