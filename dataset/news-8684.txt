LONDON — Banca Popolare di Vicenza said on Tuesday that it had set a price range for its initial public offering, in which the Italian lender hopes to raise as much as 1.8 billion euros, or about $2 billion.

The bank is seeking to sell shares by early May to meet capital requirements set by the European Central Bank.

In a news release, Banca Popolare di Vicenza said the price range for its offering was €0.10 to €3 a share.

Founded in Vicenza in 1866, the lender has total assets of €40 billion and employs 5,500 people through a network of 627 branches and other locations. It posted a loss of €1.4 billion in 2015.

UniCredit, Italy’s largest lender, is acting as the sole underwriter on the offering and had agreed to buy a big chunk of Banca Popolare di Vicenza’s shares if they went unsold.

The guarantee to buy up to €1.5 billion of unsold shares had worried some UniCredit shareholders as investor interest in Italian banks soured over concerns about bad loans in recent weeks.

On Monday, UniCredit said Fondo Atlante, a new fund set up to assist troubled Italian lenders, would guarantee UniCredit’s commitment and buy any unsold shares up to €1.5 billion.
