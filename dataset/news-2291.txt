It may not have ultimately marked the turning point hoped for, but the public handshake at the White House in 1993 between Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, and Yasir Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, was nonetheless a headline-making moment. “Oslo,” a new play by J. T. Rogers at Lincoln Center Theater, dramatizes the deal-making behind that historic encounter.

Before the two men met in Washington, secret negotiations took place in a castle in the woods outside Norway’s capital. Mr. Rogers’s characters are a mixture of Israelis, Palestinians, Norwegians and Americans, all with complex aims and complicated histories. And the playwright has impeccable sources for his imagined history: He got the story from the two diplomats who set in motion the back-channel dealings that led to what became the Oslo peace accords. Bartlett Sher, who directed Mr. Rogers’s excellent 2011 play “Blood and Gifts,” once again takes charge here.
