Werner Herzog, whose enthusiasm for human development led him to some of mankind’s earliest communications in “Cave of Forgotten Dreams,” extends his fascination in “Lo and Behold, Reveries of the Connected World.” Colored in both awe and whimsy, this documentary explores the internet and the technologies it has spawned or aided. From a brief history of the internet’s beginnings in the 1960s, to stories of abusive cyberbehavior, to interviews with roboticists, astronomists and spaceflight futurists, the film muses where this new age might be headed.

“Lo and Behold” screens on Sunday, June 19, the start of the last week of the eighth annual BAMcinemaFest, always a fine survey of indie documentaries, comedies and dramas. Among other worthy views this week are “Joshy,” an amusing bro-medy by Jeff Baena (Wednesday), and “Morris From America” (Friday), a coming-of-age story that won two awards at Sundance, including a special jury prize for Craig Robinson’s touching performance as a father raising his son in Germany.
