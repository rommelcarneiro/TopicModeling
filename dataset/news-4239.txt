Arthur Miller is having quite a run on Broadway. This past season, there were Tony-nominated revivals of two of his plays: “A View From the Bridge” (now closed) and “The Crucible” (still running).

And now the nonprofit Roundabout Theater Company says it will revive “The Price” on Broadway during the theater season that has just begun.

Roundabout said on Wednesday that it would present “The Price,” about a man’s reflections on his life as he sets about selling the furniture from his childhood home, beginning previews Feb. 16 and opening March 16 at the American Airlines Theater. The revival will be directed by Terry Kinney, a co-founder of Steppenwolf who previously directed “Reasons to Be Pretty” and “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” on Broadway. Casting has not been announced.

This will be the fifth production of “The Price” on Broadway; the original opened in 1968, and revivals were staged in 1979, 1992 and 1999.
