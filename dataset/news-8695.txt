More than 90,000 commuters a day pass through the Columbus Circle subway station. As of April 19, those who have a few moments to linger, or are even just looking for lunch, can buy dumplings, minidoughnuts, vegan cookies, grilled cheese, a bottle of wine or a Bolivian turnover like the salteña made just for this location. More than 30 shops and kiosks, about half of them offering something to eat or drink, fill the 325-foot-long concourse on the station’s mezzanine level just south of the turnstiles. Above right, food from Ellary’s Greens. Susan Fine, the developer, made a point to seek out local entrepreneurs. “A lot of them are taking a big risk,” she said. Greyston, the social service organization that makes baked goods in Yonkers, will have its first store in the mall: TurnStyle, Columbus Circle station, turn-style.com.
