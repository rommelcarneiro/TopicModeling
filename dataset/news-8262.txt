President Obama said Friday that new laws in North Carolina and Mississippi curbing the rights of gay and transgender people were “wrong and should be overturned,” weighing in on measures that have prompted a backlash, including calls to boycott the states.

Mr. Obama was asked about the laws at a news conference in London with Prime Minister David Cameron, after the United Kingdom’s Foreign Office advised travelers to those states about limitations the laws might impose.

“They are beautiful states, and you are welcome and you should come and enjoy yourselves,” Mr. Obama said. “And I think you’ll be treated with extraordinary hospitality.”

The laws are partly politically motivated, he said, and partly in response to “some strong emotions that are generated by people, some of whom are good people.”

“I just disagree when it comes to respecting the equal rights of all people, regardless of sexual orientation, whether they’re transgender or gay or lesbian,” he said.

Mr. Cameron said that the British “view on any of these things is that we believe that we should be trying to use law to end discrimination rather than to embed it or enhance it.”

Josh Ellis, a spokesman for Gov. Pat McCrory of North Carolina, said the governor agreed that everyone should expect “extraordinary hospitality” during a visit. “However, the governor respectfully disagrees with the political left’s national agenda to mandate changes to basic, common-sense restroom norms,” Mr. Ellis said.
