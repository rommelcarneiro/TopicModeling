Here are the week’s top stories, and a look ahead.

1. The presidential candidates are focused on Tuesday’s contests in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic — in states that appear to favor the front-runners, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Mr. Trump continues to assail the Republican delegate system, calling it rigged because some states have selected backers of Senator Ted Cruz to represent Mr. Trump at the convention. Mrs. Clinton’s campaign is starting to look beyond its race with Senator Bernie Sanders, and considering potential running mates.

2. Mr. Trump says he will resist attempts to alter his anti-establishment persona, while some strategists say he’s depriving the party of valuable voter data by self-funding his campaign. One of Mr. Trump’s largest expenses is air travel, but his luxury jets have helped market his brand as a successful businessman though the fleet itself is aging. As for Mrs. Clinton, we look at how she has burnished an image as a foreign-policy hawk, an approach one aide says is rooted in her “textbook view of American exceptionalism.”

3. President Obama delivered a critique of the Black Lives Matter movement during a town-hall meeting in London on Saturday, saying that activists should be more willing to work with politicians. A day earlier, the president sidestepped criticism of his plea to Britain to remain in the European Union. Mr. Obama will be in Germany on Sunday and Monday to press his case for last year’s trade deal with Asian nations.

4. Talks aimed at ending the Syrian civil war have broken down, and Secretary of State John Kerry says that a fragile cease-fire is being threatened by Russia’s military buildup outside Aleppo, Syria’s economic center. Mr. Kerry’s concerns come as Russia expands its underwater patrols of European coastlines, a move that has amplified tensions with the U.S. and NATO.

5. Music fans worldwide continue to pay tribute to Prince after the artist died on Thursday. Family and friends held a private funeral on Saturday. We examine the mysterious circumstances surrounding his death, his unique sexual identity and his sense of style. And though it may be a few centuries late, The Times has published an obituary for William Shakespeare, who died on April 23, 1616.

6. Much of the talk about money last week centered on a new $20 bill that will feature the abolitionist hero Harriet Tubman. Among those whose bank accounts brim with the soon-to-be Tubmans, a “velvet rope economy” is blossoming by providing Gilded Age-style separation of the upper and lower classes. “This is where companies are innovating and where there is demand,” an economics professor says.

7. The Olympic torch has begun its monthslong journey to Brazil for this summer’s games, but the host nation, and its president, remain mired in turmoil. The deadly collapse of a bike path in Rio has cast new doubts on the safety of the city’s Olympics-related construction. President Dilma Rousseff is fighting for her political life as she faces impeachment proceedings over a corruption scandal. Ms. Rousseff has denounced her opponents as “coup mongers.”

8. Nations signing the landmark climate deal are facing calls from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to force polluters to pay for the carbon emissions they emit. Here’s what steps the U.S., China and Europe have taken so far to curb pollution. In honor of Earth Day, we look at a closely guarded tree in a California park that is said to be more than 4,800 years old.

9. Golden State’s quest to defend its N.B.A. title hit a speed bump last week as Stephen Curry missed two playoff games with an ankle injury. Curry returned to action in Game 4 of his team’s series with Houston, only to go down with a knee injury midway through the game. The Warriors won anyway, 121-94. Here are schedules for Sunday’s N.B.A. and N.H.L. playoff games.

10. One of our most popular health stories this week was about Ida Keeling, a 100-year-old runner in New York who is a national champion. The sport helped her cope with depression following a family tragedy. Ms. Keeling says she keeps a strict diet, so she is not likely a part of the growing trend of Americans who are embracing foods high in fat, sugar and salt as definitions of what is healthy change.

11. Cuba has announced that it is easing its restrictions on sea travel. Starting next month, Carnival will begin offering cruises to the island. If flying is your preferred method of travel, avoiding the middle seat is about to get tougher.

12. Finally, “Game of Thrones” returns for its sixth season on Sunday. We’ve got you covered in case you’ve forgotten what happened last season.
