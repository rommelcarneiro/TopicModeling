A man who had been seen pushing a woman’s body on a dolly on Staten Island was arrested on Saturday and charged with murder, the police said.

Officers, acting on a tip, spotted the man, Anthony Lopez, on East 115th Street in Manhattan, between First and Second Avenues, around 10:15 a.m. Mr. Lopez, 31, who had shaved his head to alter his appearance, fled but was caught on 113th Street, the authorities said.

The police had been looking for Mr. Lopez, who lives in the Bronx, since just after 7 a.m. on Friday, when the Police Department received a call about a man wheeling a body on a metal dolly. The man fled as officers arrived at Post Lane in the Mariners Harbor neighborhood of Staten Island.

The police said the woman was Mr. Lopez’s wife, Obiamaka Aduba, 26, of Staten Island. She was pronounced dead at the scene.

Mr. Lopez was charged with second-degree murder and concealment of a human corpse, the police said.
