The 18th-century Swiss clockmaker Pierre Jaquet-Droz was famous for his technically elaborate creations — many of which incorporated music and other sophisticated complications. The company that still bears his name has now channeled his engineering prowess into a highly intricate timepiece with a startlingly spare design. The Twelve Cities watch — with a rose gold case and an ivory-hued face created in the ancient grand feu technique, in which thin layers of enamel are baked at extremely high temperatures — is aimed at a nostalgic world traveler. The hour is displayed as a numeral through an aperture at the top of the dial, and the wearer can customize the watch by choosing a favorite city in 12 different time zones. By depressing a pusher, the timepiece can be synced to any of those destinations, its name glimpsed through a second aperture reminiscent of the classic ticking departure boards of Europe’s grand train stations.
