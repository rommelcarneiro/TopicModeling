SAMMAMISH, Wash. — Brooke Henderson beat top-ranked Lydia Ko with a birdie on the first hole of a playoff Sunday in the Women’s P.G.A. Championship after overcoming a three-shot deficit on the back nine.

Henderson, an 18-year-old Canadian ranked No. 4 in the world, closed with a bogey-free six-under-par 65 — the best round of the week at Sahalee Country Club — to match Ko at six-under 278.

Ko, who led by a stroke entering the final round, finished with a 67.

In the playoff on the par-4 18th, Henderson hit her second shot from 155 yards to three feet, while Ko’s second left her with a 20-foot putt. Ko missed to the left, and Henderson tapped in to cap a week that started with a hole-in-one on her fourth hole of the tournament and ended with her first major championship.

Ko was seeking her third straight major title.

In regulation, Henderson saved par on 18 with a 12-footer moments before Ko missed a 4-foot birdie try on the par-3 17th. Henderson also made a long eagle putt on the par-5 11th and birdied the par-3 13th.

Henderson became the second-youngest winner of a women’s major championship, with Ko the youngest last year at the Evian Championship in France.
