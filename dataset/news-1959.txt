The principal of Stuyvesant High School — among New York City’s finest schools — will be taking a new job as superintendent of a struggling military academy near West Point, a school whose most prominent alumni include Donald J. Trump.

The New York Military Academy, a 127-year-old military-themed boarding school in Cornwall-on-Hudson, N.Y., announced on Monday that Jie Zhang, who has been principal of Stuyvesant since early 2013, will become superintendent in July.

Grappling with bankruptcy, the military academy was bought at auction in September for $16 million by a nonprofit conservation group run by Vincent Tianquan Mo, a real estate entrepreneur based in China and Great Neck, N.Y. The school, which once had an enrollment of 500, had just 10 students this past semester and expects 100 this coming fall. By contrast, Stuyvesant has 3,000 students.

Jin Xu, secretary of the academy’s board of trustees, said the school had hired Ms. Zhang because it felt she could recruit a top-flight staff that would in turn bring in first-rate students, half of them foreign and half local.

“This is a chance to turn this school into one of the best schools in the country,” Mr. Xu said. “She’s a world-class educator.”

In an interview, Ms. Zhang noted that at 56 she was eligible to retire with a sizable pension that she could add to her salary at the academy, which she said was comparable to her current Stuyvesant salary of $157,000. She said she was excited by the challenge of revamping a private school with the authority to hire staff and shape matters in a way she could not within a large municipal bureaucracy influenced by powerful unions.

The fact that the school’s owner is Chinese and that many of the students are expected to be Chinese was also a factor, said Ms. Zhang, who was born in China.

“I always dreamed for years of doing something that combined the two cultures,” she said. “For the first time my cultural background and language will be part of my job.”
