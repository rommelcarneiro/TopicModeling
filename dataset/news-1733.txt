OAKLAND, Calif. — Mayor Libby Schaaf removed Oakland’s interim police chief Wednesday, less than a week after appointing him amid a widening sex scandal involving several officers.

Ms. Schaaf said new information had led her to lose confidence in the interim chief, Ben Fairow. She appointed Mr. Fairow, a former assistant chief for the Bay Area Rapid Transit Police Department, on Thursday, after Chief Sean Whent resigned amid allegations that officers had had sex with an underage girl.

The mayor called Mr. Fairow’s appointment a mistake but said state law prohibited her from elaborating on her reasons.

“I made the decision to appoint Ben Fairow; I also own the decision to remove him,” she said in a statement. “I firmly believe that when you make a mistake, you need to own it and act quickly to correct it.”

Two officers have resigned in the scandal, and two others are on paid leave. Other law enforcement agencies in the area are also investigating possible sexual misconduct by their officers.
