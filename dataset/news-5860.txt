MILAN — A new exhibition at the Triennale Design Museum here is staking a claim for jewelry as a sign of the times, as well as a branch of modern design.

The museum, housed in a 1933 Rationalist-style building, was established as a venue for the extensive expositions of the decorative and industrial arts held every few years until 1996. This year the museum revived the event with “21st Century. Design After Design,” to run through Sept. 12.

One of its exhibitions, “Brilliant! The Futures of Italian Jewelry,” is the first to place jewelry in the midst of the design expo since the 1970s. (Previous exhibitions included a 1954 edition of Salvador Dalí’s surrealist precious jewels, and a highly experimental selection of jewelry curated by the artists Arnaldo and Giò Pomodoro in 1957.) “It was time for us to reconsider jewelry in the context of design,” said Silvana Annicchiarico, the Triennale’s director.

Alba Cappellieri, the exhibition’s curator, said that in recent decades “jewelry lost its artistic dignity, but this exhibition restores its value in the design world.” Fifty contemporary necklaces by Italian makers are displayed in what she calls “diverse future scenarios for the country’s jewelry.”

The craftsmanship traditional in Italy is reflected in pieces such as Giampiero Bodino’s intricate pink sapphire and rubellite collar and Pomellato’s oversize chain links in rose gold and black jet, while a new age of jewelry is introduced in materials such as titanium and carbon steel, computer-generated polyamide and interactive accessories.

Even the display reflects the meeting of tradition and technology: Figures from Italian Renaissance portraits were traced and then 3-D printed to make the white busts used to show the necklaces .

“The greatest strength of Italian jewelry is in cultivating old-fashioned materials and skills while evolving new techniques and technologies,” Ms. Cappellieri said. “Italians embrace the past with the future.”
