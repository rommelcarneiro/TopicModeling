LONDON — Shareholders are set to consider whether to approve the all-share merger of the London Stock Exchange Group and Deutsche Börse in July, after Britons vote on whether to leave the European Union, the companies said on Wednesday.

The exchange operators have previously said that an exit by Britain would not change the deal, but that it could “well affect the volume or nature” of business carried out by the combined company. A vote on whether to stay in the European Union is set for June 23.

If Britain were to leave the bloc, the merger would allow London, which has served as a financial gateway to Europe, to maintain economic ties to the Continent.

The London Stock Exchange Group and Deutsche Börse said in a news release on Wednesday that they “continue to make good progress with the preparation of the relevant documentation for their shareholders in relation to the recommended all-share merger.”

The exchanges said they would publish a prospectus on the deal in June and ask London Stock Exchange Group shareholders to vote to approve the deal in July.

A deadline would also be set in July for Deutsche Börse investors to accept an offer to exchange their Deutsche Börse stock for shares in the new holding company for the combined entity.

If the transaction is completed, Deutsche Börse shareholders would own 54.4 percent of the combined company, while London Stock Exchange Group shareholders would own the remaining 45.6 percent.

The announcement came just over two weeks after the Intercontinental Exchange, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, said it would not pursue a counter bid for the London exchange.

The Intercontinental Exchange had been seen as a potential rival to the planned merger between the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse, which confirmed that they were in discussions in February and agreed to merge in an all-stock deal in March.

This is the third attempt to combine the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse since 2000. If the merger is approved, the combined company would be based in Britain, and it would have headquarters in London and Frankfurt.

Four years ago, Deutsche Börse abandoned plans to merge with NYSE Euronext, then the parent of the New York Stock Exchange, after European antitrust regulators threatened to block the deal. NYSE Euronext was acquired by ICE in 2012 after the Deutsche Börse deal collapsed.

Euronext was spun off in an initial public offering in 2014.
