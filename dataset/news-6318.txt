Oh, hi mom. Happy Mother’s Day! Just wanted to share a couple stories about the weird things mothers do in nature.

Warning: If viewing clusters of holes sends shudders down your spine, you may want to stop now. That’s because the reproductive strategy of the Surinam toad (Pipa pipa) is a trypophobiac’s worst nightmare. But if you’re open to the disturbing yet fascinating ways in which nature blows our fragile human minds, look no further.

The male swims up to the female and embraces her — sometimes for a whole day. When it’s time to lay eggs, the two toads turn backward somersaults in the water to release the eggs, which then hit the male’s belly before bouncing back down to the mother’s back for fertilization. The toads repeat this 11-second synchronized dance 15 to 18 times and end up with 100 eggs on average. The eggs grow a kind of skin on top of them and develop over the course of 77 to 136 days. Finally, the little frog babies rip open the skin on their mother’s back and hop out into the world like it’s nothing, as you can see in this YouTube video.

A back full of eggs isn’t the only weird thing about the Surinam toad. They have no teeth, no tongue, no distinction between the head and body, and have super flat bodies that make them look dead.

If you want to go hide under your covers for the next few hours, wait. This cute video of a squirrel moving its pup to a safer nest will put you at ease.

North American red squirrels keep multiple nests within a territory to use as backup homes when fleas take over one nest or a predator gets too close. This video accompanied a study published last year in Proceedings of the Royal Society B Biological Sciences about squirrel moms. Being successful in life as a squirrel (meaning surviving) researchers found, had less to do with the little creature’s own genes than its mom’s genetic disposition to be a good nurturer.

“It all has to do with their mother’s genetic capacity to give them a head start in life,” said Andrew McAdam, an evolutionary biologist who has studied these squirrels for decades. The momma above appears to be setting up her tiny hairless baby for a solid future.
