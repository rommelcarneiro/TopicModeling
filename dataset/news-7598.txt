At a time when many have questioned whether the Los Angeles County Museum of Art would ever be able to raise $600 million for its building project, the museum announced on Wednesday that it had received $75 million from two of its loyal supporters.

Elaine Wynn, a co-founder of Wynn Resorts and a co-chairwoman of the museum’s board, pledged $50 million to start the next phase for the Peter Zumthor-designed permanent collection building.

In addition, A. Jerrold Perenchio, a Los Angeles billionaire, who helped build Univision, added a $25 million pledge to his original commitment of 47 paintings worth more than $500 million.

“There has been quite a bit of work to get the project to this point,” Michael Govan, the museum’s director and chief executive, said in a telephone interview. “These two gifts together are the largest single pledge to a cultural institution in L.A.”

The pledges are contingent on the progress of the building project, which will be subject to environmental review and public approvals this summer.

The pledges bring the total amount committed for the building so far to $275 million, including a $125 million contribution and future financing from the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, to be matched by $475 million in private support.

The project, which will replace four of seven current buildings to present the permanent collection, is on track to begin construction in mid-to-late 2018 and to open in 2023.
