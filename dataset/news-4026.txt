LONDON — Zoomlion of China said on Friday that it would drop its pursuit of the American crane and heavy equipment maker the Terex Corporation.

Terex and Konecranes of Finland announced in August that they would merge in an all-stock deal, but Zoomlion swooped in with a competing bid in January to acquire Terex for $30 a share in cash, or about $3.3 billion. Zoomlion raised its bid to $31 a share in March.

This month, Terex terminated its merger agreement with Konecranes and said it would instead sell its material handling and port solutions business to the Finnish company for about $1.3 billion.

Terex said at the time that the port deal would allow it to continue discussions with Zoomlion and would eliminate perceived regulatory concerns about a transaction with the Chinese company. Analysts had suggested that the United States authorities might raise objections over the ports business.

On Friday, Zoomlion said it walked away from the negotiations after it was unable to agree with Terex on a price after the sale of the material handling and port solutions business.

“Following negotiations, however, Zoomlion has concluded that Terex’s expectations on the valuation do not adequately reflect the impact of the sale” of the ports business, Zoomlion said in a news release. “The company has therefore decided to discontinue negotiations.”

Terex, based in Westport, Conn., manufactures cranes and other heavy equipment for a number of industries, including construction, manufacturing, shipping, energy and mining. It posted revenue of $6.5 billion in 2015 and has about 20,400 employees.

The company said its board and management had “worked diligently” to determine whether a transaction with Zoomlion was achievable.

“Unfortunately, after many months of discussions, Zoomlion was unable to provide a fully financed, binding proposal for the purchase of Terex” with or without the material handling and port services business, David A. Sachs, the Terex chairman, said. “The board is confident in our global management team and with Terex’s prospects for the future.”

Terex said that it would proceed with its plans to sell the material handling and port services business to Konecranes, a deal that is expected to close in January.

“This transaction represents excellent value realization for our shareholders,” John L. Garrison, the Terex president and chief executive, said.

After the Zoomlion announcement, Konecranes said that it would continue to work to complete its acquisition of Terex’s material handling and port solutions business.

“This acquisition will enhance our position as a focused and global leader in service and equipment in industrial lifting and port solutions,” Panu Routila, the Konecranes president and chief executive, said in a news release. “The acquisition will significantly expand our international presence to better compete in the global markets.”
