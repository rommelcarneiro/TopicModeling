Mets Manager Terry Collins, who missed his team’s game Sunday after feeling ill that morning in Milwaukee, will be back in the dugout Tuesday.

Collins was seen by a doctor at Froedtert Hospital in Milwaukee on Sunday, and the Mets said that all tests had come back negative. He was cleared by the doctor and by the Mets’ medical staff to fly back to New York.

With the bench coach Dick Scott managing in Collins’s absence on Sunday, the Mets lost, 5-3, to the Brewers. The Mets were off on Monday and start an eight-game homestand Tuesday at Citi Field against the Pittsburgh Pirates, the Atlanta Braves and the Kansas City Royals.

Collins, who turned 67 last month, is the oldest manager in the majors. He signed a two-year contract extension, through 2017, after guiding the Mets to the World Series last season.
