After 10 years as an Upper West Side anchor, Telepan has closed. The chef Bill Telepan, an owner, announced on Sunday that the restaurant would close after dinner service because its revenues could no longer cover expenses.

“Like most restaurants, we operate with very small margins,” he wrote in an email. “As our costs go up each year and our revenue has not kept pace, we have been operating at a loss and cannot sustain the business.”

The restaurant, which pursued a farm-to-table approach in an elegant setting, received two stars from Frank Bruni of The New York Times in a 2006 review that said: “It shuns trickery and puts its faith in fundamental virtues: its freshness; the pureness or punch of its flavors; the skill with which it’s been cooked.” Telepan also received a Michelin star in each of the last three years.

Mr. Telepan said he had developed a loyal clientele, and he expressed pride at having become part of the neighborhood. But like many New York restaurateurs, he found it hard to cope with rising costs for rent, food, payroll and utilities.

“We have tried raising prices,” Mr. Telepan said in a phone interview on Monday. “But you have to be careful because you become more special-occasion and not everyday.”

Mr. Telepan closed a more casual spinoff, Telepan Local, in 2014, less than a year after it opened in TriBeCa.

Mr. Telepan plans to continue working for the nonprofit organization Wellness in the Schools, which seeks to improve health for schoolchildren.

He is also exploring opportunities for himself. “I don’t know what I’ll be doing yet, but I want to get everyone in the restaurant another job, and that’s going well,” he said. “As for myself, I’m the eternal optimist.”
