A downturn in retail stocks pulled the indexes down on Wednesday.

Macy’s, the largest department store chain, slashed its annual profit forecast after it reported a steep drop in earnings. Its shares had their biggest one-day loss since 2008, and that dragged down department store, clothing, jewelry and accessories companies.

Office Depot and Staples took big losses after a judge blocked their plans to merge.

Coming off their biggest gain in two months, stocks were lower all day, and most parts of the market slumped. Health care stocks took some of the biggest losses.

But utilities companies traded higher as bond prices rose and yields fell, and energy companies rose with oil prices. The price of oil climbed after the Energy Department surprised investors by reporting that oil stockpiles shrank last week.

Retailers have a lot to worry about, said Kate Warne, investment strategist for Edward Jones. Higher oil prices are pushing up the cost of gasoline, crimping consumer spending.

“Consumers aren’t spending the way they used to spend, especially on apparel, and they’re not spending as much at the mall,” Ms. Warne said.

The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 19.93 points, or 1 percent, to 2,064.46. The Nasdaq composite index lost 49.19 points, or 1 percent, to 4,760.69.

The Dow Jones industrial average sank 217.23 points, or 1.2 percent, to 17,711.12.

Macy’s fell to its lowest price since December 2011 after it posted disappointing sales and said people had spent less on clothes and international tourists spent less. The shares dropped $5.61, or 15.2 percent, to $31.38.

Retailers including Michael Kors, Nordstrom, Kohl’s and Tiffany also took big losses. The watch and accessories maker Fossil also disclosed disappointing sales and said conditions had gotten worse. It cut its projections for the year. Its shares dropped $11.66, or 29.1 percent, to $28.44.

Office Depot and Staples plunged after calling off their proposed merger. A federal judge ruled that competition for office supplies would be reduced if the largest office-supply chain combined with the second-largest, supporting the government’s effort to stop the $6.3 billion deal.

Stock in Office Depot declined $2.46, or 40.4 percent, to $3.63 and reached its lowest price in three years. Staples shares skidded $1.90, or 18.3 percent, to $8.46.

Amazon, which is trading at nominal highs, rose $10.16, or 1.5 percent, to $713.23.

Already trading at its highest price in six months, American crude oil rose again after the government reported a surprise decline of 3.4 million barrels in supplies for last week. Oil production also fell, and is down 6 percent compared with a year ago.

American crude rose $1.57, or 3.5 percent, to $46.23 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose $2.08, or 4.6 percent, to $47.60 a barrel in London.

Energy companies also traded higher. ConocoPhillips rose 81 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $43.68 and Halliburton gained 70 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $39.54.

Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.74 percent from 1.75 percent on Tuesday.

In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline rose 10 cents, or 6.4 percent, to $1.58 a gallon. Heating oil increased 6 cents, or 4.4 percent, to $1.40 a gallon. Natural gas rose 2 cents to $2.17 per 1,000 cubic feet.

The price of gold rose $10.70 to $1,275.50 an ounce. Silver gained 23 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $17.32 an ounce. Copper picked up 1 cent to $2.10 a pound.

Germany’s DAX slid 0.7 percent and France’s CAC 40 was 0.5 percent lower. Britain’s FTSE 100 rose 0.1 percent. Japan’s Nikkei 225 edged up 0.1 percent, while South Korea’s Kospi fell 0.1 percent.

The dollar fell to 108.49 yen from 109.30 yen. The euro rose to $1.1425 from $1.1370.
