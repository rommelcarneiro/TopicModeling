Last month, the stand-up comedian Margaret Cho had a bad set at the Stress Factory in New Jersey. It happens. O.K., it was worse than usual since a clip of Ms. Cho being booed by the crowd showed up on TMZ. But for a comic, bombing is part of the job. What’s less common is getting a second chance with the same audience.

That’s the goal for an unusual show on Thursday engineered by Jerry Seinfeld after Ms. Cho told him of the bad set during a taping of an episode of his web series “Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee.”

In an invitation sent to all the ticketbuyers from her late-night show in New Brunswick on March 26, Mr. Seinfeld wrote: “At most workplaces, if there’s a problem on the job, there’s a conversation and usually some sort of outcome. But when a stand-up show doesn’t go well, the audience and the comedian both go home unhappy, sometimes not really sure what went wrong.”

Then Mr. Seinfeld made a proposal: “So as I was talking with Margaret about this show last week during the taping in L.A., we started wondering, wouldn’t it be something if we could go back to New Jersey, back to that club with the same audience and try to make things right? Have a discussion where both sides — comedian and audience — could talk about what happened? And then both of us could do a show — a sort of redo for the audience?”

At the club, Mr. Seinfeld will moderate a discussion between the comic and the audience and then perform a stand-up set, followed by one by Ms. Cho. The whole show will be taped for “Comedians in Cars.” The club owner has offered to give the patrons who attended the previous show free tickets.

In the same invitation, Ms. Cho conceded that her original set didn’t go well but made a pitch that this follow-up could be a rare opportunity. “This show is the first time anything like this has happened in this industry,” she wrote, “and I am proud to stand up for this club and give us another chance together.
