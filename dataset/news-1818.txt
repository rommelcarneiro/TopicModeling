In this episode of Modern Love: The Podcast, the actress Alysia Reiner (“Orange Is the New Black,” “How to Get Away With Murder”) reads the Modern Love essay “Those Aren’t Fighting Words, Dear,” about a woman who chooses not to react when her husband tells her: “I don’t love you anymore. I’m not sure I ever did.”

The 2009 essay was written by Laura A. Munson, the best-selling author of “This Is Not the Story You Think It Is” and the founder of Haven retreats. You can follow her on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.

Ms. Reiner is on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. She is filming Season 1 of “Better Things” for FX, which debuts this fall, and Michael Showalter’s new series, “Search Party.” Ms. Reiner also starred with the Emmy winner Anna Gunn in “Equity,” the first female-driven Wall Street film, which she also produced and introduced at the Sundance Film Festival in January.
