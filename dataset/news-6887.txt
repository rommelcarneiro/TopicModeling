Game 4 is Thursday night.

The Predators not only lost the first two in San Jose, but they were also facing the N.H.L.’s best regular-season road team. The Sharks also went 4-2 in Nashville in winning first-round series in both 2006 and 2007.

Nashville has not lost a game in regulation on home ice to San Jose since Feb. 25, 2012, with the lone defeat in seven games a shootout loss April 2. This time, the Predators shut down the Sharks’ power play, killing four penalties after San Jose went 3 of 5 in the first two games.

BLUES 6, STARS 1 Alexander Steen and David Backes had two goals apiece, and the St. Louis defense put the clamps on visiting Dallas in an easy victory that gave the Blues a two-games-to-one edge in the teams’ second-round series.

Vladimir Tarasenko had a goal and two assists, Troy Brouwer had a goal and assist, and Brian Elliott was strong when he needed to be for the Blues in their first lopsided triumph of the postseason. Their other five wins were decided by one goal.

The Blues finished 2 points behind the Western Conference champion Dallas in the regular season and have control of the series heading into Game 4 Thursday night in St. Louis.

St. Louis scored four unanswered goals after Colton Sceviour gave Dallas the early advantage. The Blues scored three times in a breakaway second period.
