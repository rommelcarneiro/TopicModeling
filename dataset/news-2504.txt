Purse: $1.5 million guaranteed Distance: One and a half miles

Track record: 2:24 (Secretariat, 1973) Weight: 126 pounds

Post time: Saturday at 6:37 p.m. Eastern Television: NBC

Joe Drape’s picks (win, place, show): Lani, Suddenbreakingnews, Exaggerator

Melissa Hoppert’s picks (win, place, show): Creator, Suddenbreakingnews, Exaggerator

Trainer: Christophe Clement Jockey: Joel Rosario Odds: 12-1

Joe Drape: This New York-bred is improving, but he will be spinning his wheels the last half-mile.

Melissa Hoppert: He finished second in the Peter Pan here, and his trainer and jockey won the 2014 Belmont with Tonalist.

Trainer: Todd Pletcher Jockey: Javier Castellano Odds: 6-1

J.D.: He was the fastest 3-year-old in March. That’s a problem since he has run only once in 13 weeks.

M.H.: The sixth-place Derby finisher is wicked fast but lightly raced. Too many question marks.

Trainer: Dale Romans Jockey: Corey Lanerie Odds: 8-1

J.D.: He splashed up for second in the sloppy Preakness. Even with rain, I don’t think he can do it again.

M.H.: The second-place Preakness finisher is a deep closer and benefited from a fast pace.

Trainer: Donnie Von Hemel Jockey: Mike Smith Odds: 10-1

J.D.: He fires every time and will be one of two running that final quarter-mile.

M.H.: Also a capable closer, he encountered trouble in the Derby but rallied to finish fifth. With a clean trip, this colt is dangerous.

Trainer: Todd Pletcher Jockey: John Velazquez Odds: 5-1

J.D.: This is the colt’s third race off a layoff, which often portends to a big effort. He will be dangerous later this summer in the Travers Stakes.

M.H.: Another speedy but late-blooming colt trained by Pletcher, the fourth-place Preakness finisher rounds out my superfecta.

Trainer: Steve Asmussen Jockey: Paco Lopez Odds: 30-1

J.D.: His only win was back in January against maidens.

M.H.: This speedy colt was entered merely as a rabbit by WinStar Farm, owner of Creator and the breeding rights to Exaggerator.

Trainer: Dallas Stewart Jockey: Florent Geroux Odds: 30-1

J.D.: Seeking a reason to think he belongs in this race. But I can’t find one.

M.H.: He just broke his maiden last month at Churchill Downs. Pass.

Trainer: Dallas Stewart Jockey: Jose Ortiz Odds: 30-1

J.D.: This one might like the extra ground enough to finish fourth.

M.H.: He also broke his maiden last month, albeit over the Belmont track. Still, pass.

Trainer: Paddy Gallagher Jockey: Aaron Gryder Odds: 30-1

J.D.: He’s winless but has a bankroll of $213,000. That’s something!

M.H.: The 16th-place Derby finisher has never won a race. Pass.

Trainer: Mikio Matsunaga Jockey: Yutaka Take Odds: 20-1

J.D.: Your winner. The Derby and the Preakness were preps. He’ll be running when the others are staggering.

M.H.: This so-called crazy horse turned in solid efforts in the first two Triple Crown races and seems to be thriving. But can he bolster his entertainment value with a paycheck?

Trainer: Keith Desormeaux Jockey: Kent Desormeaux Odds: 9-5

J.D.: I’d love to own this horse. He’s dead game and runs his race every time. I don’t think he has enough left in the tank, though.

M.H.: Along with Nyquist, this Curlin colt is the cream of the 3-year-old crop. But the Triple Crown trail is grueling, and a dry track doesn’t give him an advantage.

Trainer: Dale Romans Jockey: Luis Saez Odds: 20-1

J.D.: Beware of the hidden entry: I like this Romans horse better than Cherry Wine.

M.H.: The seventh-place Derby finisher is just not as fast as the top contenders in this race.

Trainer: Steve Asmussen Jockey: Irad Ortiz Jr. Odds: 10-1

J.D.: He gets a positive rider switch to the New York ace Ortiz after a troubled Derby. He will take some money.

M.H.: This Tapit colt wowed clockers heading into the Derby but finished 13th because of a troubled trip. Given the opportunity to run, he poses a serious threat.
