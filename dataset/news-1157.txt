The annual mash-up of choreography and couture that is New York City Ballet’s Fall Fashion Gala will outfit its dancers this September in the designs of Rosie Assoulin, Narciso Rodriguez, Dries Van Noten and Jason Wu, the company announced on Monday.

The designers have been paired with four choreographers, already announced, who are creating new works for the gala, on Sept. 20. The fall fashion gala has become a signature annual event for City Ballet, raising more than $10 million since it began in 2012. It was conceived by the actress Sarah Jessica Parker, a vice chairwoman of the company’s board.

This year’s gala will feature the choreographer Annabelle Lopez Ochoa’s first work for City Ballet, set to a selection of scores written for the cello by Luigi Boccherini, Edward Elgar and Peteris Vasks, and with costumes by Ms. Assoulin. Lauren Lovette, a principal dancer at City Ballet, is choreographing her first work for a ballet company, set to Schumann’s Introduction and Concert Allegro, Op. 134, featuring costumes by Mr. Rodriguez.

Justin Peck, the company’s resident choreographer, is creating a pas de deux set to the second movement of Martinu’s Piano Quintet No. 2, featuring costumes designed by Mr. Van Noten. And Peter Walker, a member of the company’s corps de ballet, will create his first work for the company, set to an original score by Thomas Kikta and featuring costumes by Mr. Wu.

The evening, the fifth anniversary of the fashion gala, will feature a retrospective look at the designs that have been constructed by City Ballet’s costume shop and its director, Marc Happel, in collaboration with the designers. Past galas have featured costumes by Valentino, Thom Browne and Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen, among others.
