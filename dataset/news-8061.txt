In the wake of Fathom cruise line’s announcement that it will be the first American line to travel from Miami to Cuba, the French line Ponant has received approval to cruise around Cuba. Its 64-passenger Le Ponant will begin seven- and eight-night trips in January. Passengers will gather in Miami and fly to Havana to meet the ship, making port calls in the wildlife-rich Cayo Largo, the French colonial town of Cienfuegos and the Unesco World Heritage site city of Trinidad and to Santiago de Cuba. In a “people to people” program, guests will meet Cuban artists. This is the first time the company will accommodate Americans, though it has been offering cruises to Cuba for Europeans. Eight-night trips start at $8,190 per person, double occupancy, including round-trip airfare between Miami and Cuba.
