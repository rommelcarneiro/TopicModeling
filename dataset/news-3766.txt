Adriane Sarah Glazier and the author Scott Turow are to be married May 29 at a private home in Salem, Wis., and will do so under a provision of Wisconsin law allowing couples to marry themselves. During the ceremony, Dave Barry, the humorist and a friend of the couple, is to lead the couple in the smashing of a glass and other Jewish traditions, and the Rev. John C. Cusick, a Roman Catholic priest, is to lead several blessings.

The bride, 51, is a senior vice president, advising charities and philanthropists, as an executive in two of Bank of America’s wealth management divisions. She works in Chicago. She graduated from Smith and received a law degree from Northwestern.

She is a daughter of Babette C. Glazier of Chicago and the late Robert E. Glazier.

Mr. Turow, 67, is the author of “Presumed Innocent,” “The Burden of Proof” and other books, and is a partner in the Chicago office of the law firm Dentons, handling white-collar criminal litigation. He graduated from Amherst College and received a master’s degree in creative writing from Stanford and a law degree from Harvard.

Mr. Turow is the son of the late Rita Pastron Turow and the late Dr. David D. Turow, who lived in Winnetka, Ill.

The bride’s previous marriage ended in divorce, as did the groom’s.

Ms. Glazier and Mr. Turow met in 1987 when he interviewed her for a summer clerkship with his law firm. They met again in 2012, when Ms. Glazier sought him out for career advice.
