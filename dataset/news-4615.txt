Here are the week’s top stories, and a look ahead.

1. The crash of EgyptAir Flight 804, an Airbus A320 with 66 people aboard, remains unexplained, though prior security threats are being taken into consideration. One analyst said automatic data transmissions indicated that something violent had set off “a progressive flight control system failure” as the jet moved from Greek to Egyptian airspace. It was the latest disaster for Egypt, which has suffered political turmoil, Islamist violence and other aviation disasters.

2. President Obama is beginning a weeklong visit to Asia, bolstering resistance to China’s growing strength. He’ll spend several days in Vietnam, navigating through reminders of the U.S. war and evidence of the country’s authoritarianism. He then heads to Japan, under the shadow of another killing linked to an American from the U.S. base in Okinawa. On Friday, Mr. Obama will become the first sitting U.S. president to visit Hiroshima, the site of a U.S. atomic bombing at the end of World War II.

3. Open hostility toward Hillary Clinton pervaded the presidential race. Bernie Sanders, buoyed by polls showing him beating Donald Trump by margins larger than hers, aimed to damage her further before the party convention in July. Mr. Trump called her “crooked” and “heartless” in a speech to the National Rifle Association. He accused her of wanting to overturn the Second Amendment and set violent criminals loose.

4. The steady advance of the far right in Europe could power one of the movement’s standard-bearers into the Austrian presidency. Norbert Hofer of the anti-immigrant Freedom Party appears to have a solid chance of winning today’s election. If so, he’ll be the first far-right European head of state since the end of Nazism.

5. There was a surprise in a longstanding word war. A poll showed that nine out of 10 Native Americans don’t take offense at the term “redskin,” prompting a turnaround by a prominent critic of the Washington Redskins’ name. “It’s unsettling to learn now that I vented all that energy and passion on behalf of such a small fraction of the Native American population,” wrote The Washington Post’s Robert McCartney. Still, many non-Natives think the word’s a slur. Do you? Register your opinion here.

6. A Massachusetts man broke through many layers of taboos to speak openly about his penis transplant, the first in the U.S. and the second successful one on record. Thomas Manning said he hoped that speaking out would help men suffer less stigma and more hope if they lose their genitals to cancer, like himself, or to wartime injuries. “Although his anatomy may have been damaged,” a reader commented, “he’s got courage and he’s all man.”

7. Twitter’s founder and C.E.O. wants to give 6.8 million of his own shares in the company to his workers, to compensate for the falling value of their existing portfolios. Jack Dorsey will need approval from shareholders at their annual meeting on Wednesday. And a Bloomberg report says the messaging service will soon stop counting photos and links against its famed 140-character limit.

8. Canada’s vast wildfire continues to rage, crossing from Alberta into Saskatchewan. Nearly 2,000 square miles have been charred, an area comparable to the state of Delaware. An invasion of black bears may complicate plans for the return of some of the nearly 90,000 people evacuated from the town of Fort McMurray.

9. Health news: Opioid prescriptions saw the first sustained drop in the U.S. since OxyContin hit the market in 1996. The U.S. is monitoring 279 pregnant women for possible Zika infections, 157 in the states and 122 in territories, including Puerto Rico. And a large study showed that eating potatoes four or more times a week could increase the risk of high blood pressure.

10. Finally, let us take you far, far away. NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft took nearly 10 years to reach Pluto. Our virtual-reality film, created using data from the flyby, gets you there and back in seven minutes.

Have a great week.
