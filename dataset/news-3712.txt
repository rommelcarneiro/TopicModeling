A New York State corrections officer was badly burned on Sunday morning when a package he picked up outside his home exploded, the authorities said.

Investigators said it was not clear whether the 52-year-old officer, whose name was not released, was targeted because of his work.

He sustained serious burns to his hands and arms and was in stable condition on Sunday afternoon at SUNY Upstate University Hospital in Syracuse, the authorities said.

The Oneida County Sheriff’s Office was leading the investigation, with help from the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; the New York State Police; the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision; and the Utica Police Department.

“The State of New York has no tolerance for any violence of this sort, and I have ordered a full investigation to find those responsible for this horrific incident,” Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said in a statement, adding, “On behalf of all New Yorkers, our thoughts and prayers are with this correction officer and his family during this difficult time, and we join them in hoping for a full and speedy recovery.”

The officer walked out of his home on Old Floyd Road in Floyd, N.Y., shortly before 8 a.m. and picked up the package near his mailbox, Robert Maciol, the Oneida County sheriff, said at a news conference.

The town is about 12 miles northwest of Utica, and near the Marcy Correctional Facility.

The authorities searched the neighborhood for other explosive devices, but found none.

“We’re very confident that others in the neighborhood are not in danger,” Sheriff Maciol said.

He would not describe the package in greater detail or discuss how sophisticated the explosive device was. But he said that it was clear the device was intentionally placed outside the home and that investigators were working to determine who was responsible.
