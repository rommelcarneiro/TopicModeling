Bobby Wilson hit a tiebreaking grand slam in the eighth inning against the team that had just traded him away, and the visiting Texas Rangers completed a three-game sweep of the Detroit Tigers with an 8-3 victory on Sunday.

Wilson had not homered for the Tigers before they sent him to Texas on Tuesday. His first home run of the season sent Detroit to its sixth straight loss.

Tom Wilhelmsen (2-2) got the win in relief for Texas.

WHITE SOX 3, TWINS 1 Chicago struck out four times in an inning and still managed to score a run in a win over visiting Minnesota for its fourth sweep this year.

Chicago’s Jose Quintana (5-1) gave up one run in seven innings and lowered his E.R.A. to 1.38.

In the seventh, Tyler Duffey became the first Twins pitcher in nearly four years to strike out four batters in an inning, but Avisail Garcia reached on a wild pitch and scored on Dioner Navarro’s double.

DIAMONDBACKS 5, BRAVES 3 Chris Herrmann hit two home runs, including one with a man on in the 11th inning, to give visiting Arizona a three-game sweep at Atlanta.

The Braves (7-23) have lost four straight and are off to their worst 30-game start since at least 1900.

CUBS 4, NATIONALS 3 Chicago walked Bryce Harper a record-tying six times, then beat visiting Washington when Javier Baez homered in the 13th inning for a four-game sweep.

The Cubs won their seventh in a row and improved their best-in-the-majors record to 24-6. Harper matched the major league record for walks in a game; the last to do so was Jeff Bagwell in 1999. Harper was also hit by a pitch.

PIRATES 10, CARDINALS 5 Gregory Polanco hit a three-run homer and John Jaso added a two-run shot, and Pittsburgh beat host St. Louis.

Gerrit Cole (3-3) gave up two runs on six hits in six innings.

DODGERS 4, BLUE JAYS 2 Howie Kendrick hit a tiebreaking single in the eighth inning, and Los Angeles won at Toronto. Joc Pederson hit his sixth homer as Los Angeles took two of three from Toronto.

PHILLIES 6, MARLINS 5 Tyler Goeddel hit a run-scoring double for his first career extra-base hit and then scored in a two-run eighth inning, helping Philadelphia rally at Miami.

ASTROS 5, MARINERS 1 Collin McHugh went seven innings and host Houston beat Seattle.

Seattle’s Robinson Cano had a solo blast that gave him five homers and 17 R.B.I. against Houston this season.

ORIOLES 11, ATHLETICS 3 Manny Machado hit two of Baltimore’s season-high six homers, including a grand slam, and the host Orioles scored all their runs on long balls in a rout of Oakland.

Machado homered with one on in the first inning and hit his third career slam in the eighth.

INDIANS 5, ROYALS 4 Josh Tomlin stayed unbeaten and Cleveland beat visiting Kansas City. Tomlin became the first Indians pitcher to win his first five outings since Justin Masterson in 2011.

BREWERS 5, REDS 4 Jonathan Lucroy hit a tiebreaking home run to start the eighth inning, then caught Billy Hamilton stealing for the final out as Milwaukee won at Cincinnati.

RAYS 3, ANGELS 1 Matt Andriese pitched seven innings of four-hit ball to win his season debut as Tampa Bay completed a three-game sweep of host Los Angeles.

Brad Miller and Curt Casali both homered for the Rays, who have both won four straight and moved above .500 for the first time since last August.

ROCKIES 2, GIANTS 0 Eddie Butler pitched six innings for his first win since being called up, and Colorado won at San Francisco to split a four-game series.

Colorado’s Nolan Arenado, the majors’ leading home run hitter, had a run-scoring triple in his first at-bat, then singled in the third and doubled in the eighth.

AT 42, COLON GETS A CARD Mets starter Bartolo Colon has his own baseball card to commemorate the moment when he became the oldest player to hit his first major league homer.

Topps has issued a card with a photo that shows Colon, his swing completed and his eyes gazing upward. Across the bottom are the words “The impossible becomes possible — Colon hits 1st career HR at age 42.”

The card is part of a new effort by Topps to quickly celebrate big moments during the season. So far this year, cards have been printed to mark the steal of home plate by the Yankees’ Jacoby Ellsbury and the no-hitter by Jake Arrieta of the Cubs, among others. KEN BELSON
