Officials in Georgia have decided not to file charges in the death of a 3-year-old boy who pulled a gun from his father’s backpack and fatally shot himself in the chest in April.

The boy, Holston Cole, was one of four young children who died from accidental, self-inflicted gunshot wounds during a one-week span in April. According to a statement released by the Paulding County Sheriff’s Office on Thursday, sheriff’s detectives and the county district attorney’s office decided not to move forward with charges, saying the evidence suggested that the shooting was not intentional.

“Detectives confirmed that this was an accidental shooting and that charges will not be pursued,” the statement said.

The deaths of the four children in one week encapsulated how cases like these can be handled differently from state to state, and depending on the details of each case:

• After Sha’Quille Kornegay, a 2-year-old in Kansas City, Mo., shot and killed herself with a gun her father often kept under his pillow, the authorities charged her father, Courtenay Block, with second-degree murder and child endangerment.

• In Natchitoches, La., after 3-year-old Za’veon Amari Williams shot himself in the head, Alverious Demars, 22, a companion of the boy’s mother, was charged with negligent homicide and obstruction of justice. The weapon has not been recovered.

• In Indianapolis, Kanisha Shelton, the mother of 2-year-old Kiyan Shelton, was charged Tuesday with a felony count of neglect after her son shot himself in the chest with a gun he found in her purse, the Indianapolis Star reported.

In Holston’s case, officials had previously suggested that Mr. Cole would not face serious charges for the death.

“Anything that we do, criminally speaking, is not going to hold a candle to the pain that this family feels,” Sgt. Ashley Henson, a spokesman for the sheriff’s office, said in April.

According to a redacted recording, Holston’s father, David, could be heard on the 911 call yelling “No, no!” as he fought to keep his son alive.
