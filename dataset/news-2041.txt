The worst mass shooting in United States history did little to halt the politicking of the 2016 presidential election. If anything, in some respects, it accelerated it.

Fifty people died in the shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla., and the suspect, who was born in the United States to immigrants from Afghanistan, was reported to have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State. President Obama called the shooting both “an act of terror” and an “act of hate,” and he postponed an appearance with Hillary Clinton scheduled for Wednesday in Wisconsin.

Mrs. Clinton issued a statement after the president spoke, offering similar thoughts and condolences to the victims and their families and a quick plea to curtail the availability of guns, before concluding, “This is a time to stand together and resolve to do everything we can to defend our communities and country.”

Donald J. Trump took a different tack. Mr. Trump offered prayers for the victims, but he swiftly criticized Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama throughout the day. He also posted praise for himself on Twitter for his call for a ban on Muslim immigrants. “Must be tough,” Mr. Trump wrote in one post, calling for Mr. Obama to resign in another post for not using the phrase “radical Islamic terrorism.”

Mr. Trump’s proposed ban would not have prevented this attack; the suspect was a United States citizen. Still, Mr. Trump is forging ahead with a speech on Monday that had been about Mrs. Clinton, but will now focus on national security.

Mrs. Clinton had plans to deliver a speech condemning Mr. Trump as a demagogue, but she is now expected to broaden it toward national security.

Nearly four years ago, when a gunman killed 12 people in Aurora, Colo., Mr. Obama halted his campaign, and Mitt Romney, then the Republican nominee, canceled a speech. The nature and tenor of national politics has changed a great deal since then.
