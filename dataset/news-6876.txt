Julia Leach, who grew up in Minnesota by way of France, has been taking regular trips to Mexico since she was 5. Her travels have brought her all around the country — from Zihuatanejo to Punta Mita, Tulum to Mexico City. So for the latest collection of her six-year-old line of travel-inspired items, Chance, she looked to the country as a source of inspiration: “For me, it’s less about the artisanal visual and cultural references that we know, and more about the sea and the jungle and the natural beauty,” she said. The range of items, available online beginning today, include basket bags she produced in collaboration with the Los Angeles-based designer Eliza Gran, her signature striped shirts now rendered in tie-dye — and enormous straw hats, brimmed with feathers.
