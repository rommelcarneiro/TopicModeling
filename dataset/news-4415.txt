Rib-eyes have interesting new competition this grilling season. Consider yak steaks. Tasty and extremely lean, the boneless yak strip loin (shown) should be seared rare or medium-rare, then sliced sashimi thin. Or try a beef sirloin cap, called culotte in France and picanha in Brazil. Trim back the top layer of fat and grill it over medium heat, then slice it. Finally, the collar of Mangalitsa heritage pork makes for a luscious couple of portions if you donâ€™t mind some fat. You can also trim out the lean portion, uncooked, to use for kebabs: Yak steaks, $85 for four, heritagefoodsusa.com; picanha, $17 a pound at Le District, in the store only, ledistrict.com, and $17.99 at Fleishers, in the store only, fleishers.com; Mangalitsa pork collar, $16.50 for 10 to 12 ounces, mangalitsa.com.
