A federal jail guard was sentenced on Wednesday to seven years in prison after an inmate gave testimony about how he raped her inside a Manhattan jail.

“It wasn’t consensual sex,” the unidentified woman told the guard, Rudell Mullings, as she read from a statement in federal court in Brooklyn. “It was rape.”

Mr. Mullings pleaded guilty last year to a charge of sexually abusing a prisoner, which carries a term of up to three years in prison under sentencing guidelines.

The inmate, who was sentenced to 30 years for a homicide, told Judge Edward Korman of Federal District Court that Mr. Mullings had harassed her for several weeks before accosting her on Feb. 14, 2015, in a hallway where she was waxing the floor.

On Wednesday, Mr. Mullings’s lawyer asked for six months of jail time and six months of house arrest.

But Judge Korman — after criticizing prosecutors for not making Mr. Mullings plead guilty to more serious charges — called the guidelines “ludicrous,” given the circumstances. A harsher sentence was needed, he said, to send a message “that this conduct is totally unacceptable and deserves severe punishment.”
