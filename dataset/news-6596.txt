Why he chose pillows over fashion — and what inspired London’s most beloved nightclub.

Rifat Ozbek belongs to a small but special club that has no name, comprised of artists who walk away from the spotlight at the peak of their fame. In the 1980s and ’90s, he was named designer of the year — twice — by the British Fashion Council for his madcap East-meets-West aesthetic. His clothes were modeled by Linda, Naomi and Kate, and worn by the likes of Madonna and Tina Chow. “I mixed patterns and colors. Things that didn’t seem to go together — at least to the Western eye,” says the Istanbul-born designer. Then, about a decade ago, Ozbek felt the cycles had grown too demanding, and so took refuge in designing his holiday home in Bodrum, Turkey. He began making decorative cushions with textiles from Central Asia and Uzbekistan and filling them with down and Turkish lavender. From that, Yastik, his line of exquisite pillows, was born. They can be found in some of the most fashionable sitting rooms in Europe and London, where Ozbek has a shop. “I wanted to simplify my life and do one product: no seasons, no fit problems,” he laughs. Ozbek rarely takes on side projects, but in 2012 he did decorate Loulou’s, the nightclub portion of 5 Hertford Street, Robin Birley’s London club. The result was a much-buzzed-about cavern of decadence with the designer’s signature mash-up on display (including an eight-foot stuffed giraffe). This summer, three new Ozbek-designed floors will open at 5 Hertford Street, featuring more of his unrepentant, joyful touch. “The only thing that scares me is clinical minimalism,” he says. “The one thing I am absolutely not is minimal.”
