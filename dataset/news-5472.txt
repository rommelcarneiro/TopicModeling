Artsy and UBS on May 18 will show the first in a series of four short films that explore the contemporary art market — auctions, galleries, patrons and art fairs.

Combining historical footage with commentary from leading figures like the collector Eli Broad, the Art Basel director Noah Horowitz and the dealer Dominique Lévy, it will be shown on Artsy and UBS Art Studio, the contemporary art film portal.
