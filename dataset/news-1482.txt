Spain, the defending European champion, booked a place among the final 16 of the 2016 European Championships on Friday with a convincing 3-0 win over Turkey in Nice, France.

Spain, coached by Vicente del Bosque, controlled the Group D match from the kickoff, with two goals by Juventus’s Álvaro Morata and a first competitive international goal from Nolito sealing a comfortable win.

“We showed our winning mentality and great team spirit here tonight,” said Andrés Iniesta, who was named man of the match.

“It depends on ourselves how far we go here,” he added. “The feelings we have are very positive at the moment.”

Turkey needs to beat the Czech Republic in its final match and hope other results go its way to have any chance of progressing as one of the four best third-place sides from the six groups.

Before the game, Turkey Coach Fatih Terim had called for more “fight” from his side.

“Today our national team threw in the towel,” he said. “I didn’t like it.” (AFP)
