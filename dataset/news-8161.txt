The Chinese wuxia martial arts film — marked by the clang of swordplay and the silent glide of wire-aided leaps — has never had a more influential master than King Hu, who infused the genre with a lyrical sophistication and a meditative mysticism. Fans include Ang Lee (“Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon”) and Quentin Tarantino (“Kill Bill”).

And Hu never made a better wuxia adventure than “A Touch of Zen” (1971), the first Chinese entry to receive an award at the Cannes Film Festival. An epic tale of a young woman fleeing a corrupt Ming dynasty governor, the movie was initially shown in two parts, over Hu’s objections. Now, Film Forum presents the uncut three-hour version in a print that features vividly green bamboo forests, balletic fighting monks and Hsu Feng, one of cinema’s fiercest warrior women. As an opening credit notes, Ms. Hsu, who would act in numerous King Hu movies before becoming a film producer herself, paid for the digital restoration of her mentor’s greatest work.
