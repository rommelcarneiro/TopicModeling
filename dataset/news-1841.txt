Gabor Kiraly set an age record at the European Championships and helped Hungary beat Austria, 2-0, on Tuesday in Bordeaux, France.

Kiraly, Hungary’s goalkeeper, became the first 40-year-old player to participate in the championship.

Adam Szalai gave Hungary the lead with his first goal in 12 appearances.

“I don’t want to talk about myself,” Szalai said. “The whole team won. Everyone worked together. I think we managed to do everything our manager told us in terms of advice and strategy.”

The substitute Zoltan Stieber scored Hungary’s second goal after Austria was reduced to 10 players when Aleksandar Dragovic was shown a second yellow card.

Austria thought it had tied the score moments after Hungary’s first goal, when Martin Hinteregger put the ball in the back of the net, but it was waved off for a foul and Dragovic was sent off.

Kiraly made some good plays, including a diving stop of Zlatko Junuzovic in the 35th minute.
