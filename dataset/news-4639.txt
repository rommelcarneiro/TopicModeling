Christopher James Beacham, the son of Martha Miller Beacham and James R. Beacham of Portsmouth, Va., was married May 21 to Adam Michael Scott, a son of Laurie Peterman Scott and John B. Scott of Coppell, Tex. The Rev. Dr. Jon M. Walton performed the ceremony at the First Presbyterian Church in Sag Harbor, N.Y.

Mr. Beacham (left) 28, and Mr. Scott, 34, both work in New York in the securities unit of Wells Fargo & Company, the San Francisco-based bank. Mr. Beacham is an investment banking associate, helping to develop municipal bonds, and Mr. Scott is an associate analyst, conducting research for stocks in the beverage, tobacco and convenience-store industries.

Mr. Beacham graduated from the University of Pennsylvania. His mother retired as an administrative assistant at the Chesapeake, Va., campus of Tidewater Community College. His father retired as an industrial hygiene chemist for the United States Navy in Norfolk, Va.

Mr. Scott graduated from Wake Forest and received an M.B.A. from N.Y.U. His father retired as a manager in the treasurerâ€™s department of the Exxon Mobil Corporation in Irving, Tex.; he oversaw finances for affiliates of the company.

The couple met at the housewarming party of a mutual friend in New York in September 2012, and a few weeks later, after Hurricane Sandy displaced Mr. Scott from his downtown apartment, their relationship moved forward when Mr. Beacham offered him refuge.
