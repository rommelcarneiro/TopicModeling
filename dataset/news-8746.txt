Michael Friedman, the composer and lyricist behind “Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson,” will be the next artistic director of Encores! Off Center, a City Center program that every summer presents concert performances of musicals previously staged Off Broadway and beyond.

Mr. Friedman will succeed Jeanine Tesori, the founding director of the program, who announced this year that she would step down after this summer’s productions of “Runaways” and “Kurt Vonnegut’s God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater.” Ms. Tesori, who won a Tony Award as the composer of “Fun Home,” will remain affiliated with City Center as an artistic adviser.

Mr. Friedman, a 40-year-old native of Philadelphia, said in a telephone interview that he would seek to continue programming work by “the fullest spectrum of all the different people who have made musicals in America.”

“It is very important to me that we look at people who have been overlooked, or forgotten, or whose place in the canon could be stronger,” he said. “And I’m going to be excited by work that has something to say to today’s audience.”

Mr. Friedman has been a frequent collaborator with the Civilians, and has written music for many shows, including “The Fortress of Solitude.” He is currently collaborating with The New Yorker and WNYC on songs about the 2016 election.
