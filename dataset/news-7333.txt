We then added our total scores, and he came out on top, 733-654. He then declared himself the winner. I contend that by winning two out of three games, I should be allowed to claim that title.

I hate to rule against a child, especially after three close contests, but Yahtzee, like politics, is a machine designed to grind the idealistic dreams of youth to dust. Though he played admirably, each game of Yahtzee is a winner-take-all contest. There is no proportional point allocation nor superpoints he can hope to court. In this brokered contest, I name the winner Dad. And it has nothing to do with my discomfort with your childâ€™s racism and tiny, tiny hands.
