Patricia Gilchrist Gleacher, the daughter of Anne Gilchrist Hall of New York and Eric J. Gleacher of North Palm Beach, Fla., was married June 18 to Graham Nash Pitcairn, the son of Martha Nash Pitcairn and Duncan Bruce Pitcairn of Bryn Athyn, Pa. The Very Rev. Denis Brunelle, an Episcopal priest, performed the ceremony at St. Lukeâ€™s Episcopal Church in East Hampton, N.Y.

Until June 9, Mrs. Pitcairn, 26, was a preschool teacher at the Meadowbrook School, an elementary school in Meadowbrook, Pa. She graduated from Northwestern University and received a master of science in education degree from Bank Street College of Education.

Her father, who retired as the chairman of Gleacher & Company, an investment bank in New York, is now a partner in Promethean Investments, an investment bank in London. He is also a trustee of Northwestern University. Her mother is a trustee of Prep for Prep, a nonprofit leadership program in New York that places high-achieving minority students in elite institutions. The bride is also the stepdaughter of Paula Gleacher and John H. Hall.

Mr. Pitcairn, also 26, is a United States Coast Guard helicopter pilot stationed in Atlantic City. He graduated with distinction from the United States Coast Guard Academy.

His mother is the founder of Ignition Academy, a life-counseling program for adults in Bryn Athyn. His father is principal partner and the treasurer of Cairnwood Cooperative, a trust- and estate-management firm in Huntingdon Valley, Pa. He is also a trustee of Thomas Jefferson University.

The groom is a great-grandson of Harold F. Pitcairn, who developed and manufactured the autogiro, the precursor to the modern helicopter.

The couple met in 2011 on a five-week mountaineering course in Patagonia, Chile. While hunkered down on a glacier during a blizzard, they bonded over card games and hot chocolate.
