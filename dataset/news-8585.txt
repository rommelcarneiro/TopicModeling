This season, bridal designers plucked many of their most arresting ideas from the recent ready-to-wear runways. The spring 2017 collections, shown last week, mirrored a diversity of trends that first made a splash on the catwalks of New York, London, Paris and Milan.

Unveiled (ahem) in settings as romantic as a wisteria-hung garden (Monique Lhuillier) or as slick as a glamorous penthouse (Elie Saab), the most eye-catching looks bowed to tradition while reaching for freshness and relevance.

In keeping with a spirit of tireless reinvention, last season’s brazenly transparent gowns gave way to airy but discrete variations in lace or tulle; trouser suits stepped in for the conventional floor-sweeping gown; bared shoulders emerged as bridal wear’s latest erogenous zone; and a flurry of boudoir inspirations were sexy without crossing into outright decadence.

Even a number of skin-baring looks were countered by covered-up styles that echoed ready-to-wear’s on-again, off-again romance with Victoriana. Starchy high collars, chaste necklines, slender arm-sheathing sleeves, virginal capelets and cascading ruffles suggested that even for some stubbornly progressive brides, this year prim is in.
