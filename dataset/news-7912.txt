“A truffle hound rooting through the concrete jungle” is how the singer Celia Berk described her search for little-known musical gems celebrating the glories of New York at the Metropolitan Room on Sunday. Ms. Berk, a native New Yorker, is a cabaret traditionalist whose taste runs to Rodgers and Hart and Irving Berlin standards. Although her new show, “Manhattan Serenade,” includes contemporary songs like “The Party Upstairs,” Ronny Whyte and Francesca Blumenthal’s witty description of a noisy, never-ending bacchanal on the floor above, they are carefully crafted numbers in a prerock format.

Ms. Berk has a strong, steady mezzo-soprano with perfect enunciation and a rich, sensual lower register. Although she can belt, her characteristic approach is conversational.

She straddled the line between today and yesterday with Rupert Holmes’s brilliant “The People That You Never Get to Love,” which describes romantic daydreams in a city of strangers who never meet because they are all headed in different directions. The lyrics include the zinger “The saddest words that anyone has ever said are ‘Lord what might have been.’” Ms. Berk didn’t camouflage the eerie bleakness of “Lonely House” from the Kurt Weill-Langston Hughes opera, “Street Scene.”

With the help of Margaret Whiting’s daughter, Debbi, she recalled finding a truffle in a cache of trunk songs written by Margaret Whiting’s father, Richard, with Gus Kahn and completed by Tex Arnold. Under the title “Every Song Sounds Like a Song About New York,” she sang an amusing seven-part medley that included “The Phantom of the Opera” and “Ah! Sweet Mystery of Life.”

Underneath the show’s starry-eyed cheeriness and sense of wonder ran a deep current of nostalgia. Ms. Berk made you feel about New York the same way a Cole Porter song makes you feel about Paris. The Internet age may have revolutionized courtship etiquette, but the awe and romantic possibility that the city evokes are boundless.
