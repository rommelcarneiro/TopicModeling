Exelon, a leading competitive power provider, plans to shut two money-losing nuclear plants in Illinois, the company said Thursday, after efforts to push a bailout through the state’s Legislature fell apart.

The company will close the Clinton Power Station in Clinton next June and the Quad Cities Generating Station in Cordova in June 2018.

Slowing demand for electricity and a flood of cheap natural gas have driven down the price of power, and the two plants, like others in the aging system across the country, have struggled to compete in wholesale markets. The two Exelon plants lost $800 million over the last seven years, the company said.

“We have worked for several years to find a sustainable path forward,” Chris M. Crane, Exelon’s chief executive, said in a prepared statement. “Unfortunately, legislation was not passed, and now we are forced to retire the plants.”

The announcement comes as the Obama administration and state and federal lawmakers are suddenly working to help support the flagging industry as part of the effort to reduce carbon emissions and stem global warming. Nuclear plants produce the country’s largest share of electricity without emitting carbon dioxide and can operate as needed. Their proponents are pursuing different ways to maintain the plants despite unresolved questions over waste disposal, safety and the potential for converting their operations to make weapons.

Supporters of the Exelon bailout argued that the plants were important not only to the effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also to supporting thousands of jobs. But many opponents of the bailout — both some who support the use of nuclear energy and some who do not — say the public has already paid for the plants and should not have to again. And they say the company, which took in $34.5 billion in revenue last year, can afford to keep the plants open.

Executives at the company, which operates a dozen other nuclear plants in six states, ultimately disagreed and said they would continue to push for the new regulations.

The closings could put as much as $1.2 billion in annual economic activity and as many as 4,200 direct and indirect jobs at risk, including 1,500 plant workers, the company said, but employees may be able to transfer to positions elsewhere in the company.

Industry executives and supporters of the bailout bemoaned the shutdowns.

“The premature closures of Clinton and Quad Cities continue an alarming trend — our nation is losing top-performing nuclear power plants due to flawed electricity market conditions,” said Marvin S. Fertel, chief executive of the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry trade group. “In the process, we are moving farther away from achieving our nation’s ambitious clean air commitments.”

Evan Bayh, a former Democratic senator and governor from Indiana who is co-chairman of Nuclear Matters, which promotes the technology’s use for energy, said Illinois gets 92 percent of its carbon-free electricity from nuclear sources.

“The absence of Clinton and Quad Cities will make it near impossible for the state to reach its carbon reduction goals,” he said.

Opponents of the bailout said the company had only itself to blame.

“Illinois ratepayers and the Illinois General Assembly are not to blame for the closing of these plants,” said Lisa Madigan, the state’s attorney general. “Unfortunately, a highly profitable company is choosing to close plants because it hasn’t received a blank check to impose unfair and unnecessary rate hikes on Illinois consumers.”
