This is what to expect from the week ahead:

For fans of tech stocks, this week is a cornucopia of earnings information. IBM kicks things off on Monday, followed by Intel and Yahoo on Tuesday, Google and Microsoft on Thursday and other companies throughout the week. That is a pretty diverse bunch of giants, but they share a common theme: How are they coping? IBM has suffered multiple tough quarters as people move from its high-priced services, while Intel is hoping its cloud computing data centers will make up for missing the smartphone boom. Google is starting to play catch-up in cloud services against Amazon. Microsoft, another cloud provider, has to move its old software businesses to the new computing system. Yahoo, which lost out to Google and others, is coping with something else entirely: On Monday, bids to buy all or part of the company are due. Quentin Hardy

The last of the big banks will report their first-quarter earnings this week, with Morgan Stanley announcing its results on Monday and Goldman Sachs Tuesday. Both banks have set low expectations, in line with the lackluster profits and revenues that the other big banks declared last week. The other banks reported particularly weak results in their Wall Street divisions. That does not bode well for Morgan Stanley and Goldman, given that they are the most Wall Street-focused firms in the industry. Analysts will seek more information about the cost cuts that Morgan Stanley announced last quarter. Similar cuts may be in store at Goldman. Nathaniel Popper

On Tuesday, the Commerce Department will report the latest data on new housing starts in March. After a 5.2 percent jump in February, the biggest monthly increase since September, construction growth is expected to have moderated but still rise slightly for the month. Buoyed by low-interest rates and steady jobs growth, the real estate market has been fairly strong, which is helping the economy even as other sectors like manufacturing soften. Nelson D. Schwartz

A battle over encryption is heading again to Capitol Hill as Apple and F.B.I. officials appear before House members to defend their positions. In a hearing on Tuesday before a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee, Apple’s general counsel, Bruce Sewell, and the F.B.I.’s executive assistant director for science and technology, Amy Hess, will testify on separate panels. The issue has pitted the technology sector against law enforcement in a broader debate over privacy and security. The F.B.I. has pushed for access to encrypted data in terrorist and other criminal investigations. Apple has fought back, saying some of the F.B.I.’s demands to decrypt technology would weaken its products’ security and infringe on users’ privacy. The company’s court battle with the F.B.I. over a phone used by a shooter in the San Bernardino attack was recently resolved, but the two parties continue to fight over the unlocking of an iPhone used in a New York drug case.

UnitedHealth Group, one of the nation’s largest health insurers, will be reporting its first-quarter earnings on Tuesday. Last year’s profits suffered because the company said it had lost hundreds of millions of dollars selling individual policies under the federal health care law. UnitedHealth’s chief executive said the company would leave the exchange if it could not make money. Investors will be watching for signs that the company has turned the business around — or has plans to make good on its promise to exit the exchange. Reed Abelson

The European Central Bank will meet on Thursday in Frankfurt, but is not expected to make any changes to policy. At its last meeting in March, the bank’s Governing Council announced a battery of stimulus measures aimed at raising inflation, which is near zero, back to the official target of below 2 percent. Mario Draghi, the president of the central bank, is expected to argue on Thursday that the measures, which include paying banks to make loans, will be enough to avert a downward spiral of consumer prices that could be disastrous for growth and jobs.

General Motors on Thursday will report first-quarter earnings that are expected to improve, primarily because of continued strong sales of its pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles in its core North American market. Its performance in international divisions is expected to be uneven, with modest gains forecast in Europe and possibly weaker results in China. On Friday, G.M., the nation’s largest automaker, will release compensation figures for 2015 for its senior executives, including Mary T. Barra, its chief executive and chairwoman. Bill Vlasic

Volkswagen faces a Thursday court deadline to present a plan to fix nearly 600,000 diesel cars in the United States that are polluting more than allowed. Some lawyers in the case were optimistic there would be a broad agreement to compensate Volkswagen owners and settle enforcement actions brought by state and federal governments. Other lawyers were more cautious, saying the settlement talks remained difficult. Last month Judge Charles R. Breyer for the Federal District Court in San Francisco said he would hold a trial this summer if Volkswagen is not able to reach a settlement.

The company’s supervisory board on Friday may also disclose some of the findings of an internal investigation on who was responsible for programming 11 million diesel cars, mostly in Europe and the United States, to evade emissions limits. The investigation is being conducted by the law firm Jones Day on behalf of the supervisory board. The damage to Volkswagen’s reputation has been elevated by the company’s failure, seven months after the fraud came to light, to explain the circumstances behind it. Jack Ewing

Eurozone and European Union finance ministers will hold two days of meetings in Amsterdam starting on Friday. The bloc’s 19 eurozone ministers are expected to seek an agreement with Greece on reforms in exchange for more bailout aid so that Greece can pay back debt that matures in July. Among the numerous issues that have held up agreement is the push by the International Monetary Fund to ease the repayment burden on Greece as a condition for helping to finance last year’s 86 billion euro bailout, the nation’s third in five years. The bloc’s 28 finance ministers are also scheduled to discuss proposals requiring companies to disclose more data about their offshore arrangements. The proposals were announced in the wake of the Panama Papers, which exposed ways the rich and powerful use tax havens. James Kanter

The big moves for General Electric are in the rearview mirror. Its post-financial crisis campaign of returning to its industrial roots and shedding much of its once-bloated finance arm is complete. On Friday, when G.E. reports its quarterly results, analysts will scout for signs of health in the industrial economy. Expect a mixed picture, with strong sales of jet engines and power generators strong and weak oil field equipment sales. Even if G.E. does well, the stock price may not respond. Its price-earnings ratio is high, Wall Street figures. Big moves stir excitement in a way steady execution does not. Steve Lohr
