Drake stays on top of the Billboard album chart for a third time this week, as his latest album, “Views,” passes the half-billion mark in streams.

When “Views” (Young Money/Cash Money/Republic) came out late last month, fans could get it only from Apple. Yet the album scored huge opening-week numbers: more than 850,000 downloads and almost 250 million streams, a new peak that more than doubled the streaming record set only a week before by Beyoncé. In its third week out, “Views” has gone to Spotify and other online services, giving the album a second wind online and keeping it securely at the top of the chart.

In its latest week, “Views” had only 83,000 sales, but songs from it racked up 186 million streams, according to Nielsen. Since the album came out, the songs have been streamed 572 million times in the United States; in each of the three weeks that “Views” has been out, it has had higher streaming numbers than any album has ever had. Drake has also reclaimed No. 1 on the Hot 100 from Justin Timberlake; the rapper’s “One Dance” replaces “Can’t Stop the Feeling!” at the top of the singles chart.

Another streaming exclusive also starts high: Chance the Rapper’s “Coloring Book,” a mixtape that for now is available only from Apple, opened at No. 8 with 57 million streams and — since it is not available in any other format — zero sales.

Also this week, Beyoncé’s “Lemonade” (Parkwood/Columbia) holds at No. 2 while Meghan Trainor’s “Thank You” (Epic) opens at No. 3 and the San Diego rock band Pierce the Veil starts at No. 4 with its new record, “Misadventures” (Fearless). Rihanna’s “Anti” (Roc Nation) is up two spots at No. 5 in its 17th week out.
