BUENOS AIRES — Argentina returned to global bond markets on Monday after a 15-year hiatus, unveiling the biggest sovereign issuance by an emerging-market nation in two decades as the government ends a prolonged feud with hedge funds in New York.

The country was receiving offers from investors for its sale of $10 billion to $15 billion of bonds. Most of the cash raised will go toward paying off a small number creditors, including the hedge fund billionaire Paul E. Singer, who had rejected restructuring offers and took Argentina to court seeking full payment after it defaulted in 2001.

Officials at the Economy Ministry have been courting investors in the United States and London over the last week, and Alfonso Prat-Gay, the finance minister, described demand for the bonds as “awesome.” The bond sale is one of the largest by a so-called emerging-market nation since Mexico raised $18.1 billion across several issuances in 1996, according to Dealogic, a finacial date provider.

Although some investors remain cautious, the bonds are expected to attract broad interest. “It won’t be very problematic for the government to get the $15 billion,” Miguel Kiguel, an economist and former deputy finance secretary, wrote in El Cronista, a local business newspaper.

The final hurdle to the issuance, which was limited by lawmakers who have grown wary of Argentina’s cycles of debt and default, was cleared last week with a decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.

Creditors accepted 70 to 75 percent of their claims in agreements earlier this year. The bond sale was expected to close on Tuesday, with the creditors receiving their money by Friday.

Payment to the creditors is expected to total about $10.5 billion, ending a decade of mudslinging after the new government of President Mauricio Macri sought to reignite a sluggish economy with policies intended to lure foreign investors.

“The issuance of external debt is likely to have a significant impact on the economy over the medium term,” Edward Glossop, an economist who tracks Argentina for Capital Economics, an economic analysis firm in London, said in a research note.

Still, domestic critics and international experts have questioned the ethics of ceding to the litigating creditors, saying it paves the way for them to extort other countries.

Argentina has included clauses in the new bonds intended to protect it from similar lawsuits in the future in the case of another default. If a majority of creditors agree to a restructuring, in theory everybody must conform.

Even though investors look favorably on Mr. Macri’s administration, Argentina is still viewed as risky. It therefore needs to pay higher rates on the bonds — about 7 to 9 percent — than some of its neighbors in Latin America have done in recent years.
