Leslie Odom Jr., who won a Tony Award on June 12 for his portrayal of Aaron Burr in “Hamilton,” said on Sunday that he would leave the cast of that show on July 9.

Mr. Odom is the fourth Tony-nominated member of the original Broadway cast to plan a departure: Jonathan Groff left on April 9, and Lin-Manuel Miranda and Phillipa Soo are also scheduled to leave after the evening performance on July 9.

The exodus, much of it less than a month after the show won the coveted Tony Award for best new musical, stems from two factors: The show began performances on Broadway last summer, so one-year contracts signed by cast members are about to expire, and the show’s unusual prominence has led to other opportunities for some of its performers.

Mr. Odom recently released a solo jazz album. Mr. Groff left to record a new Netflix series, “Mindhunter”; Ms. Soo will star in a new musical, “Amélie”; and Mr. Miranda has multiple projects, including a leading role in a live-action Disney film that will be a sequel to “Mary Poppins.”

Mr. Odom announced his departure in a brief video on Facebook Live that he broadcast from his dressing room before Sunday’s matinee.

“It has just been the most completely wonderful, totally healing and inspiring experience from beginning to end,” he said of his time in the “Hamilton” cast. “I’m excited to have a blank page again,” he added. “I’m excited to go out and find something new.”
