A jump in oil prices and some deal news helped send stocks up broadly Monday, breaking a three-day losing streak.

Investors bought from the start of trading, pushing oil drillers and other energy stocks up sharply.

A bullish oil report from Goldman Sachs helped send benchmark U.S. crude up 3.3 percent to its highest close in six months. All 10 sectors of the Standard and Poor’s 500-stock index rose.

Major indexes were also boosted by news that the billionaire investor Warren Buffett had invested in Apple, triggering a 3.7 percent jump in that stock. Apple is the most heavily weighted member of the S.&P. 500.

The S.&P. 500 rose 20.05 points, or 1 percent, to 2,066.66. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 175.39 points, or 1 percent, to 17,710.71. The Nasdaq composite index gained 57.78 points, or 1.2 percent, to 4,775.46

The report from Goldman argued that the glut in oil supplies has turned into a “deficit,” and so prices could continue to rise. The sunny forecast, plus oil production troubles in Nigeria, pushed U.S. crude up $1.51 to $47.72 a barrel.

When oil prices climb, investors think the “earnings drought is at an end,” said Tim Courtney, chief investment officer of Exencial Wealth Advisors. “Whatever happens to energy drives all the markets.”

Energy shares in the S.&P. 500 rose 1.6 percent on Monday. Marathon Oil jumped 4 percent and Devon Energy also rose 4 percent.

In deal news, Tribune Publishing soared $2.61, or 23 percent, to $14.08 after USA Today owner Gannett raised its offer to buy the publisher. The new offer comes one week after Tribune, which owns The Los Angeles Times, The Chicago Tribune and other newspapers, adopted a “poison pill” plan to help it remain independent. Gannett rose 2.2 percent.

Memorial Resource Development rose 41 cents, or 3 percent, to $13.86 per share after rival natural gas producer Range Resources said it would buy Memorial for $3.3 billion. Range Resources plunged $4.32, or 10 percent, to $37.69.

Anacor Pharmaceuticals rocketed 57 percent to $100.67, a gain of $36.64, after drug giant Pfizer announced a deal to buy the maker of a topical eczema treatment for $5.2 billion. Pfizer rose 19 cents, or 0.6 percent, $33.38.

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway bought 9.8 million shares of Apple, a stake worth almost $1 billion. Apple rose $3.36 to $93.88.

The tech giant’s shares have been under considerable pressure, declining by 15 percent over the past month after Apple reported a drop in iPhone sales in late April.

The move also was of interest given Mr. Buffett’s long-standing aversion to tech stocks. He has said it’s too hard to determine what tech companies will be worth in the future because their businesses evolve so quickly.

In overseas markets, Britain’s FTSE 100 inched up 0.2 percent while the CAC-40 in France slipped 0.2 percent. Trading in Germany was closed for a holiday.

In other energy markets, Brent crude, used to price international oils, slipped rose $1.14, or 2.4 percent, to $48.97 a barrel in London. In other energy trading in New York, wholesale gasoline rose 2 cents to $1.61 a gallon, heating oil rose four cents to $1.44 a gallon and natural gas fell seven cents to $2.03 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Precious and industrial metals prices closed higher. Gold gained $1.50 to $1,274.20 an ounce, silver rose 2 cents to $17.15 an ounce and copper added 2 cents to $2.09 a pound.

U.S. government bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.76 percent from 1.70 percent. The dollar rose to 108.98 yen from 108.63 yen and the euro rose to $1.1320 from $1.1307.
