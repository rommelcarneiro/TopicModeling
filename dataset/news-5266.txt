Nestlé, the global food behemoth, tailors its chocolates to particular countries. In Turkey, it makes Damak bars, which come in dark, lighter or “fine” chocolate, and milk chocolate riddled with that country’s pistachios. Now Nestlé USA has started selling the bars in America. They break into tiny squares that beg to be eaten in multiples: Damak Pistachio Chocolate Bars, 2.82 ounces, six for $15.67 (fine chocolate), $18.08 (dark chocolate) and $21.25 (milk chocolate), nestledamak.com.
