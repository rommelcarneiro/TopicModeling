The Mets did not wait long to fill their first-base vacancy, acquiring the proven journeyman James Loney on Saturday from the San Diego Padres for cash.

Loney, 32 and a 10-year veteran, will be part of a platoon to replace Lucas Duda, who sustained a spinal injury and is expected to be out for up to six weeks.

This season, Loney was hitting .342 for El Paso of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League. He batted .280, with four homers and 32 R.B.I., last year with Tampa Bay before he was released this spring. Loney, a left-handed hitter, ranked as the second-toughest hitter in the American League to strike out in 2015.

“He’ll add a nice dimension,” Mets Manager Terry Collins said. “I’ve known him since he was 17. A good first baseman, not tremendous power. He’ll face right-handed pitchers.”

Collins was uncertain when Loney would be available.
