HONG KONG — The organizer of a party at a water park in Taiwan last year that ended with a fiery explosion that killed 15 people and injured hundreds was sentenced to nearly five years in prison for negligence on Tuesday.

The so-called Color Play Party at the Formosa Fun Coast park in New Taipei City in June featured tons of colored powder that was thrown over participants as they listened to music and danced. But the material was flammable, and it ignited when it was blown over a hot electric light, the Shihlin District Court said in its ruling.

Color Play Asia, the company that organized the party, had said the powder was a mixture of cornstarch and food coloring.

Lu Chung-chi, the owner of Color Play Asia, was found guilty of negligence and sentenced to four years and 10 months in prison. Last year, he apologized for the disaster.

In addition to those killed, all of whom initially survived but succumbed to injuries in the ensuing days, 331 people sustained serious burns and injuries and 135 people had less severe injuries.

“Most of these victims were young, their beautiful lives just about to begin, beautiful dreams yet to be achieved, promising futures yet to be created,” the court said in a statement on the sentencing. “Because of the explosion, 15 lost their lives, and the majority of the survivors are subject to enormous physical and mental pain and suffering.”

Relatives of some of the victims protested outside the court on Tuesday, calling for justice in the case, Taiwan’s Central News Agency reported.

The mother of Liu Chih-wei, 19, who died of severe burns, denounced Mr. Lu. “You can die 15 times and be burned 499 times over and still not understand our pain,” she said, according to the news agency.
