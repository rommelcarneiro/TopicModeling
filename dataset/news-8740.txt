PHILADELPHIA — Mets starting pitcher Jacob deGrom moved closer to returning to the team when his newborn son was released from the hospital.

DeGrom left the team to be with his wife, who gave birth last week to a baby boy who developed an undisclosed illness.

Manager Terry Collins said Monday that deGrom will pitch a simulated game in Florida on Tuesday. Depending on how he performs, deGrom could start one of the Mets’ games in Atlanta later this week.

DeGrom has appeared in only one game this season, giving up one run in six innings during the Mets’ home opener against the Philadelphia Phillies on April 8.

However, he left the game after throwing only 76 pitches because of tightness in his back. Collins said he wanted to know what kind of stamina deGrom had before deciding whether to allow him to start against the Braves.

If deGrom is not ready, the Mets can continue to rely on Logan Verrett, who has given up only one run in seven innings.

“Every team looks for a guy like” Verrett who can pitch well in a spot start or out of the bullpen, Collins said. Verrett will make his second start of the season on Tuesday against the Phillies.
