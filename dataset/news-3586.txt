LONDON — Producers of the new Harry Potter stage play, “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,” have released the first official photographs of several of the show’s actors in costume.

Previews of the production, in which the action takes place 19 years after the end of the final “Harry Potter” book, start June 7 at the Palace Theater in London.

The play (a two-part show that visitors can watch in a single day or over the course of two days) centers on Harry as a middle-aged Ministry of Magic employee, whose son, Albus, is coming to terms with his magical powers. J. K. Rowling co-wrote the story on which the play, by Jack Thorne, is based.

The first batch of official images was released on Tuesday. Additional photographs issued on Wednesday show Paul Thornley as Ron Weasley, Noma Dumezweni as Hermione Granger, and Cherrelle Skeete as Rose Granger-Weasley. The news that Ms. Dumezweni, who is black, would play Hermione, drew worldwide attention when it was announced last year.

Comments from the actors appeared on the official website, Pottermore, along with the photographs.
