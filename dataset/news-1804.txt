The new musical “Bright Star” will be shining for just a few more weeks.

The Broadway show, a collaboration between Steve Martin and Edie Brickell, will close on June 26, the producers said Tuesday. At that point, it will have played 30 previews and 109 regular performances.

The musical, inspired by a newspaper article about a baby found in a valise, tells the story of a pregnant teenager whose baby is taken from her, and what happens in each of their lives.

It received some positive reviews, particularly from Charles Isherwood in The New York Times, who said, “The musical is gentle-spirited, not gaudy, and moves with an easygoing grace where others prance and strut.” And it was nominated for five Tony Awards, including for best new musical, best original score, and best leading actress (Carmen Cusack), but won none.

The show has struggled to find audiences since it began performances on Feb. 25. Last week, which was its best to date, it grossed $527,807, which is 58 percent of its box-office potential, and its average paid admission was a modest $79.11.

The musical, with Joey Parnes as lead producer, cost $10.5 million to capitalize.
