Talk about a short memory. Kyle Korver came out shooting, and this time he couldn’t miss.

The Boston Celtics? They couldn’t make anything.

Shaking off a dismal performance in the playoff opener, Korver swished four 3-pointers in the opening minutes to propel Atlanta to a stunning 21-point lead before many fans had settled into their seats Tuesday night. There wasn’t much doubt after that, the host Hawks cruising to an 89-72 victory and a 2-0 lead in the Eastern Conference series.

“We all have pride, right?” said Korver, who went 1 of 10 on Saturday and missed all seven of his 3-point attempts. “I wanted to come out and play better the second game.”

As good as Korver and the Hawks were in the early going, this one will be remembered more for the Celtics’ grisly start. They scored just 7 points over the first 12 minutes, the lowest-scoring opening quarter in a playoff game since the N.B.A. went to a shot clock in 1954.

“I don’t know what it is,” said Boston’s Jae Crowder, looking a bit shellshocked after scoring just 2 points on 1-of-9 shooting, “but we’ve got to change something.”

Crowder had plenty of company in his shooting misery.

The Boston star Isaiah Thomas was held to 16 points on 4-of-15 shooting, going 1 of 6 beyond the arc. Marcus Smart stepped in for the injured Avery Bradley and went 1 of 11, also making just 1 of 6 from 3-point range. The Celtics finished at 32 percent over all (28 of 88), 5 of 28 from long range.

The first quarter was off-the-charts bad. Boston made just 3 of 23 shots and missed all six of its 3-point attempts. The Hawks blocked six Boston shots.

According to Stats L.L.C., the previous record for fewest points in an opening playoff quarter during the shot-clock era was 8, set by Utah in 1988 against the Los Angeles Lakers and matched by Dallas in 2010 at San Antonio.

It was also Boston’s lowest-scoring playoff quarter since the N.B.A. was founded in 1949.

SPURS 94, GRIZZLIES 68 Patty Mills had 16 points, Kawhi Leonard added 13, and host San Antonio never trailed in routing Memphis for a 2-0 lead in their first-round Western Conference series.

LaMarcus Aldridge had 10 points and 8 rebounds in 26 minutes. Aldridge sat out the entire fourth quarter along with Leonard and Tony Parker, while Tim Duncan and Danny Green made brief appearances.

If history and Memphis’s current state are any indication, the Grizzlies’ prospects do not look good heading into a home game Friday night.

San Antonio’s suffocating defense held Memphis to franchise lows in total points and points in a quarter — 11 in the first.

Tony Allen led Memphis with 12 points, and Zach Randolph had 11 points and 12 rebounds.

CRAWFORD WINS AGAIN Jamal Crawford, a 36-year-old Los Angeles Clippers guard, won the N.B.A.’s Sixth Man Award, becoming the first three-time winner as the league’s best reserve. Two years ago, he was the oldest to receive the honor.

Crawford received 51 first-place votes and 341 points from a panel of 130 sportswriters and broadcasters in the United States and Canada. Andre Iguodala of Golden State finished second with 288 points (33 first-place votes), and Oklahoma City’s Enes Kanter was third with 182 points (19 first-place votes).

Crawford averaged 14.2 points in 79 games, coming off the bench in 74 of them. He ranked second in the N.B.A. in free-throw shooting at 90 percent.

Crawford, a 16-year veteran, added his latest trophy to his awards in 2009-10 with the Atlanta Hawks and 2013-14 with the Clippers.

NOWITZKI HURTS KNEE Add Dirk Nowitzki to the long injury list for Dallas in the playoffs.

Coach Rick Carlisle said that Nowitzki bruised his right knee when he fell early in the Mavericks’ 85-84 Game 2 win over Oklahoma City in a first-round playoff series that is tied 1-1.

Nowitzki joins a list of players who might miss Game 3 on Thursday, including the starting guards Deron Williams and J. J. Barea and the backup forward David Lee.

SUNS KEEP COACH The Phoenix Suns are retaining Earl Watson as head coach for next season.

Watson was named interim coach after Jeff Hornacek was fired on Feb. 1. The team went 9-24 under Watson.
