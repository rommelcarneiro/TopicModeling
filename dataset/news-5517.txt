Eight people were killed and 44 injured after their charter bus rolled over on a South Texas highway on Saturday morning, officials said.

The crash happened around 11:25 a.m. in Webb County, the Texas Department of Public Safety said in a statement.

The bus, owned by OGA Charters, was traveling north on Route 83 and went off the road about 42 miles north of Laredo after the driver lost control, the department said. The bus rolled over on a flat stretch of road in the rain, a department spokesman, Sgt. Juan Hernandez, said in an email.

Seven people were declared dead at the scene, and an eighth was pronounced dead at a hospital, the department said. Their identities were not available Saturday night.

The bus had 52 people aboard, including the driver, who survived. Fifteen people brought to Laredo Medical Center were in stable condition, said a hospital spokeswoman, Priscilla Salinas.

Others from the bus were taken to Doctors Hospital of Laredo, Dimmit Regional Hospital in Carrizo Springs and University Hospital in San Antonio. Their conditions were not immediately available.

The bus was traveling to Eagle Pass from the Rio Grande Valley, the authorities said. Phone messages and emails to the bus company were not returned on Saturday.

The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administrationâ€™s website listed OGA of San Juan, Tex., as having a satisfactory rating, with six inspections over the past two years.

The charter company reported having two buses that traveled 40,000 miles in 2014; no crashes were reported in the past two years, according to federal records.

In 2011, the company was fined a total of $1,990 for two separate violations related to pre-employment testing of drivers for controlled substances and the inspection, maintenance and repair of vehicles, according to the website. Additional details on those violations were unavailable on Saturday.
