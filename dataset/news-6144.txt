WASHINGTON — The Pentagon said on Monday that an airstrike by the United States-led coalition had killed one of the Islamic State’s senior military commanders in Iraq.

The attack, on May 6, killed Abu Wahib, the Islamic State’s chief military official in Anbar Province, said Peter Cook, the Pentagon spokesman. He said the strike had hit a vehicle carrying Mr. Wahib, also known as Shakir Wahib, and three other Islamic State members near the town of Rutba.

Mr. Wahib had appeared in Islamic State execution videos, and Mr. Cook said he had been a member of the group since it was known as Al Qaeda in Iraq, during the American occupation.

Anbar Province has been a center of the influence for the Islamic State since it seized vast stretches of Iraq in 2014. Offensives by the Iraqi government and its allies have focused on reclaiming population centers in the province, including the recent retaking of Ramadi, which is the provincial capital, and of the town of Hit.

Mr. Wahib’s death would be another setback for the Islamic State after months of apparent losses on the battlefield in Iraq and Syria. Iraqi officials and news outlets have reported Mr. Wahib’s death several times over the past year, though this is the first time the Pentagon has publicly said he had been killed.
