ORLANDO, Fla. — The city’s civic and religious leaders gathered on Tuesday night for prayer and song at the First Baptist Church of Orlando to mourn the 49 victims who died at the Pulse nightclub early on Sunday.

The service began with a salute to members of Before You Exit, the band that performed on Friday night at a music venue in Orlando where a gunman shot to death the singer Christina Grimmie after the performance.

But pastors — representing black, Hispanic and white congregations — and the mayor insisted that despite a weekend that had begun with one horror and ended with another, Orlando would resist being labeled by its latest tragedies.

“Hate will not define us,” Mayor Buddy Dyer said. “Hate will not defeat us — because we are one Orlando united.”

Mr. Dyer was making a reference to the OneOrlando Fund, created to raise money for the victims of the shooting. The mayor said the money would go to nonprofit organizations serving the victims and their families, as well as gay, Hispanic, faith and other affected communities. The city will also open a family assistance center on Wednesday.

Among those in attendance, along with local politicians, was Cornell William Brooks, the president of the N.A.A.C.P. The crowd gave resounding applause to the city’s police chief, John Mina, and county sheriff, Jerry L. Demings.

A standing ovation went to a young man introduced as Joshua, who survived the shooting.
