The dance-music producer Zhu (pronounced like “zoo”) followed a prolific apprenticeship with a rapid ascent. In 2011-12, mostly unnoticed, he released a track a week online for a year, forging his particular combination of crisply understated house beats, minor-key melodies, pop-song structures and, often, his own wispy falsetto. Those elements defined his worldwide 2014 hit, “Faded,” which brought him a Grammy nomination. Since then, after early attempts at concealing his face, he has gone public and collaborated with Skrillex, A-Trak and Kaskade. His two nights at Terminal 5 promise more than a laptop: a feature-length film and live instruments. (8 p.m., Wednesday and Thursday, May 11 and 12, Terminal 5, terminal5nyc.com.)

But Zhu isn’t sticking around for New York’s season-opening electronic dance music festival, Electric Daisy Carnival. With headliners like Zedd and Afrojack on Saturday, May 14, and David Guetta on Sunday, it has a promising addition: the hypnotic techno D.J. Nicole Moudaber has programmed a Moodzone stage all day on Sunday. (1-11 p.m., Citi Field, electricdaisycarnival.com.)
