There’s an elephant at a zoo outside Seoul that speaks Korean.

— You mean, it understands some Korean commands, the way a dog can be trained to understand “sit” or “stay”?

No, I mean it can actually say Korean words out loud.

— Pics or it didn’t happen.

Here, watch the video.

To be fair, the elephant, a 26-year-old Asian male named Koshik, doesn’t really speak Korean, any more than a parrot can speak Korean (or English or Klingon). But parrots are supposed to, well, parrot — and elephants are not. And Koshik knows how to say at least five Korean words, which are about five more than I do.

The really amazing part is how he does it. Koshik places his trunk inside his mouth and uses it to modulate the tone and pitch of the sounds his voice makes, a bit like a person putting his fingers in his mouth to whistle. In this way, Koshik is able to emulate human speech “in such detail that Korean native speakers can readily understand and transcribe the imitations,” according to the journal Current Biology.

What’s in his vocabulary? Things he hears all the time from his keepers: the Korean words for hello, sit down, lie down, good and no.

Lest you think this is just another circus trick that any Jumbo, Dumbo or Babar could pull off, the team of international scientists who wrote the journal article say Koshik’s skills represent “a wholly novel method of vocal production and formant control in this or any other species.”

Like many innovations, Koshik’s may have been born of sad necessity. Researchers say he started to imitate his keepers’ sounds only after he was separated from other elephants at the age of 5 — and that his desire to speak like a human arose from sheer loneliness.
