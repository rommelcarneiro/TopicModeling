Stock indexes moved solidly higher on Monday, recovering some of the steep declines of last week.

Recently battered technology stocks like Amazon.com and Microsoft posted gains, helping to end a seven-day losing streak in the Nasdaq composite index.

The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index added 16.13 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,081.43, and the Nasdaq rose 42.24 points, or 0.9 percent, to 4,817.59.

The Dow Jones industrial average rose 117.52 points, or 0.7 percent, to 17,891.16.

Notably, Apple did not participate in Monday’s gains, closing down 10 cents, or 0.1 percent, to $93.64. Apple has fallen eight days in a row, and has lost 16 percent of its value in the last two weeks.

Technology stocks have been an unexpected drag on the market. Last week, Apple reported its first quarterly decline in profits in years, which sent ripples through the stock market. In response, investors have been moving into safer investments. The Dow Jones utility index, a collection of 15 dividend-paying utility companies, is up more than 14 percent this year.

“There’s a risk-off sentiment in the market right now,” said David Lebovitz, a global market strategist at J. P. Morgan Funds.

Overseas, Japan’s Nikkei stock index fell more than 3 percent overnight as markets there reopened after a holiday. The market fell as Japanese investors continued to react negatively to the Bank of Japan’s decision to leave interest rates unchanged. The Japanese yen also continues to climb sharply, which hurts Japanese exporters.

“It’s a bit concerning.” Mr. Lebovitz said. “Investors are beginning to question whether monetary policy can really push Japan’s economy forward and generate growth.”

Among individual companies, Halliburton rose after a $34 billion merger with Baker Hughes was called off in the face of antitrust concerns from the Justice Department. Halliburton rose 74 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $42.05. Baker Hughes fell 96 cents, or 2 percent, to $47.40.

The Apollo Education Group, which runs the University of Phoenix, rose sharply after a group of investors raised its bid for the company. Apollo rose 97 cents, or 12.4 percent, to $8.77.

In economic news, the Institute for Supply Management said on Monday that its manufacturing index came in at 50.8 last month, down from a 51.8 reading for March but above the 50 threshold that signals growth. The March number ended a five-month losing streak for manufacturers.

Export orders grew faster in April, but new orders and production grew more slowly last month than in March. A measure of employment fell, suggesting that factories are cutting workers.

In a separate report, the Commerce Department said that construction spending rose 0.3 percent in March after a 1 percent gain in February. The consecutive increases raised total spending to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.14 trillion, the highest level since October 2007.

The increase in February represented an upward revision by the government from its initial estimate that spending had fallen 0.5 percent for the month. But the government revised the estimate for January down to show a drop of 0.3 percent, from a previously reported increase of 2.1 percent.

The report showed that “the housing market remained robust” through the first quarter of the year, said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at Barclays Research.

Benchmark American crude oil fell $1.14 to close at $44.78 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, fell $1.54 to close at $45.83 a barrel in London.

In other energy trading in New York, wholesale gasoline fell 4 cents, to $1.56 a gallon; heating oil lost 3 cents, to $1.36 a gallon; and natural gas dropped 14 cents, to $2.04 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.87 percent from 1.83 percent late Friday. The dollar slipped to 106.45 yen from 106.37 yen while the euro strengthened to $1.1516 from $1.1448.

Precious and industrial metals futures ended mixed. Gold rose $5.30, to $1,295.80 an ounce; silver fell 13 cents, to $17.66 an ounce; and copper lost 2 cents, to $2.26 a pound.
