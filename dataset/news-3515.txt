Mets pitcher Noah Syndergaard played the role of vigilante on Saturday, throwing behind Los Angeles Dodgers second baseman Chase Utley with his 34th pitch of the game. For his action, he was ejected.

Mets Manager Terry Collins did not seem to mind the act much. But realizing that Syndergaard, his prized starter, came well short of a day’s work, Collins used him as a relief pitcher during Tuesday night’s 6-4 loss to the Chicago White Sox at Citi Field.

Syndergaard’s scheduled routine maintenance went swimmingly, however. He threw a scoreless seventh inning, punctuated by a swinging strikeout of Todd Frazier, the major league home run leader, with a 92-mile-per-hour changeup. The pitch ended the inning and held the Mets’ lead at 4-3.

But after Syndergaard left, the White Sox roughed up Hansel Robles for three runs in the eighth inning, with the key damage a two-run homer by Tyler Saladino.

“It’s pretty obvious,” Collins said of Robles’s trouble, “command of his fastball. He’s just got to make better pitches.”

Steven Matz stifled the White Sox for five scoreless innings, but he was tagged for three runs in the sixth. The Mets had built an early advantage by putting a run on the board in the first and second innings. In the third, Neil Walker homered for the second straight game, floating a ball over the right-field wall to bring in Michael Conforto, spotting Matz a 4-0 lead.

When Syndergaard entered in the seventh inning, the home crowd rose to its feet. He opened by unfurling a 100-m.p.h. fastball to the leadoff hitter Adam Eaton, before eventually striking him out with the same pitch. Mets fans again rose to salute Syndergaard after he retired Frazier.

“The way I wanted it was for us to be up 8-0 and him pitching the ninth,” Collins said of Syndergaard.

It would prove to be the last moment of joy in a game that whizzed past the Mets as fast as Syndergaard’s fastball behind Utley’s back.
