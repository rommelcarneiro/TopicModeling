In separate announcements on Monday, Mike Tirico said he was leaving ESPN, where he called “Monday Night Football,” to join NBC Sports, and ESPN said it had promoted Sean McDonough from college football to the Monday night games.

“It’s a dream of a lifetime, especially growing up in my house, with my dad,” McDonough said, referring to his deceased father, Will, a football writer for The Boston Globe who also worked for NBC Sports as a reporter.

The younger McDonough was the lead network voice of a sport in the early 1990s when he called Major League Baseball for CBS, and he wondered if such an assignment would come his way again.

“I wasn’t sure I was willing to stay if they felt I wasn’t capable of being a signature voice on a property of this type,” McDonough said on a news media conference call.

But he was assured at ESPN that the opportunity would come, and it did, about two weeks ago, when Tirico chose to go to NBC.

Tirico said in a separate call that the opportunity to play a role at the Olympics for NBC was the main reason he left ESPN.

He is also expected to be part of NBC’s “Thursday Night Football” package, and coverage of golf and other sports. If not for NBC’s offer, he said, “I’d probably be at ESPN for another five or 10 years.”
