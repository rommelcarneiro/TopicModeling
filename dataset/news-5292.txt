Still reeling from revelations that forced the resignation of its founder and chief executive, Lending Club said on Monday that it had received a subpoena from the Justice Department.

The company, which serves as an online matchmaker between small-business borrowers and individual and institutional lenders, disclosed the grand jury subpoena in a regulatory filing, saying it intended to cooperate with the federal investigation.

A week ago, Lending Club, which is based in San Francisco, revealed that its founder and chief, Renaud Laplanche, had resigned after an internal investigation discovered fabrications in about $3 million of loan applications.

The internal inquiry turned up other problems, including the sale of $22 million of loans to the investment bank Jefferies that Lending Club employees knew did not meet certain of Jeffries’s specifications.

The internal review also revealed that Mr. Laplanche had invested in a fund that was buying the company’s loans without informing the Lending Club board, which includes prominent members like Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary and former Harvard University president.

The disclosure of a criminal subpoena, which the company received last Monday — the day it announced Mr. Laplanche’s departure — is another big blow to Lending Club. Once considered the pioneer in its field, Lending Club is now fighting to defend the soundness of its business model.

Even before the internal problems became public, Lending Club and other marketplace lenders had been having trouble selling their loans because of growing doubts about the long-term viability of their business.

Marketplace lending — which is fast and efficient — had been considered a potential disruptive force to the banking establishment, but now some analysts question whether it can bounce back from the recent turmoil. When it went public in December 2014, Lending Club’s stock closed at $23.43 a share. On Monday, it closed just shy of $4 a share.
