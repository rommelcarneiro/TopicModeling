The Dow Jones industrial average ended above 18,000 on Wednesday as declines in the dollar lifted some commodity-related shares and helped the outlook for multinational corporations.

The benchmark Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was up for a third straight session and is now about 12 points shy of its benchmark closing high of 2,130.82.

“I think the good news for the market is that the sentiment is still far from euphoric. So if you have data just chug along and no major shocks, you could potentially have the market gap higher,” said Marc Pouey, United States equity and quantitative strategist at Bank of America in New York.

The S.&P. 500 materials index climbed 0.6 percent after gains in copper and gold prices. Energy shares were lower despite a jump in oil prices.

Helping sentiment was a weaker dollar, which tends to benefit American multinationals that derive a large portion of their sales from overseas. The S.&P. industrials index rose 0.7 percent.

“The weaker dollar and strength in commodity names is certainly helping to fuel the market’s strength,” said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. “Multinational companies are all benefiting and helping to drag the market higher.”

The dollar fell to a five-week low against a basket of currencies as traders reduced bets of an imminent interest rate increase.

The Dow Jones industrial average rose 66.77 points, or 0.37 percent, to 18,005.05, closing above 18,000 for the first time since April 27.

The S.&P. 500 gained 6.99 points, or 0.33 percent, to 2,119.12, while the Nasdaq composite index added 12.89 points, or 0.26 percent, to 4,974.64.

With the S.&P. so close to its highs, it “is going to provide some psychological resistance in the market, and you may see a little pause there,” Mr. James said.

Federal Reserve officials meet next Tuesday and Wednesday, and are expected to leave rates unchanged.

In the bond market, 10-year Treasury yields fell to 1.70 percent, from 1.72 percent on Tuesday, and prices rose.

Crude oil futures remained above the psychologically important $50-a-barrel level on worries about sabotage of oil facilities in Nigeria.

Energy Information Administration data showed American crude oil inventories fell for the third consecutive week but gasoline and distillate stockpiles rose as refiners ramped up output.

Brent crude settled up $1.07, or 2.08 percent, at $52.51 a barrel, while crude prices in New York settled up 87 cents, or 1.73 percent, at $51.23.

Bucking the recent trend in retail stocks, Lululemon Athletica shares rose almost 5 percent, to $71.48, after first-quarter sales beat analyst expectations.

Among the day’s decliners, shares of VeriFone Systems fell almost 25 percent, to $21.27, a day after the company announced lower-than-expected earnings. The company also said it intended to reduce head count and conduct a strategic review to address underperforming businesses.
