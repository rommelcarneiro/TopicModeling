A group of 20 Russian soccer fans has been deported from France after being accused of involvement in hooliganism at the European Championships.

The deportations, from the Nice airport, follow mass fighting in the streets involving English, Russian and French fans in the days before last week’s 1-1 draw between England and Russia.

The fans had been accused by the Marseille prefect Stephane Bouillon of “participation in skirmishes linked to the England-Russia game.”

Despite their impending removal from France, Alexander Shprygin, the leader of a Russian fan group who is among the 20 to be deported, told The Associated Press that their visas would not be canceled and that all planned to return to France for Russia’s match on Monday against Wales.

“What has happened to us is a complete outrage,” Shprygin said by telephone from the airport, adding that the 20 had not been involved in any disorder.

Shprygin, who leads the government-linked All-Russian Fans’ Union, has been accused of far-right links.

The 20 were part of a larger group of Russians detained Tuesday following violent disorder around England’s 1-1 draw with Russia on June 11, when groups of Russians were involved in attacks inside and outside the stadium. French authorities, acting on a tip from the Russian police, raided a hotel near Cannes last Sunday and combed through hundreds of hours of video to link suspects to the disorder.

Three Russians were convicted of offenses related to the violence and were sentenced to prison terms of one to two years.
