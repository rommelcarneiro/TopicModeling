This week on the music charts, Drake’s new album holds off Radiohead and Beyoncé to stay at No. 1, while Justin Timberlake has the top single.

Drake’s “Views” (Young Money/Cash Money/Republic) had a huge opening on last week’s chart. Consumption of the album in its second week has cooled by 70 percent and “Views” is notching 175,000 sales and nearly 141 million streams, according to Nielsen. But that was more than enough to keep it at the top.

Beyoncé’s “Lemonade” (Parkwood/Columbia) holds at No. 2 on the album chart with 153,000 sales and almost 27 million streams, and Radiohead’s new “A Moon Shaped Pool” (XL), which was released on Sunday, May 8 — two days into the industry’s retail accounting week — started at No. 3 with 173,000 sales and 7.3 million streams.

Mr. Timberlake’s new song, “Can’t Stop the Feeling!,” from the soundtrack to the forthcoming animated film “Trolls,” opened at No. 1 on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart, becoming Mr. Timberlake’s fifth chart-topper as a solo artist. It bumped Drake’s “One Dance,” which held the top spot for one week.

Among other new albums this week, Keith Urban’s “Ripcord” (Capitol Nashville) opened at No. 4 and Cole Swindell’s “You Should Be Here” (Warner) bowed at No. 6. “The Very Best of Prince” (Warner), which shot to No. 1 in the days after Prince’s death last month, remains a strong seller, falling one spot this week to No. 5.
