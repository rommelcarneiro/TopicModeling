A group of documents from 1857 that set down some of the fundamental rules of baseball was acquired at auction Sunday by an unidentified buyer for $3.26 million, making it one of the highest-priced pieces of sports memorabilia.

“Laws of Base Ball” was put up for online bidding this month by SCP Auctions; the price paid was the most ever for a baseball document but below the $4.3 million paid in 2010 for James Naismith’s original 13 rules of basketball. The most expensive piece of sports memorabilia is a Babe Ruth jersey from 1920 that sold for $4.4 million in 2012.

“Laws,” which was written by Daniel Adams, who was known as Doc, established rules such as nine men on a side, 90-foot base paths and nine innings to a game. Adams played for the Knickerbocker Base Ball Club, where he pioneered the shortstop position, and later became its president as baseball’s popularity increased. He referred to batters as “strikers,” balks as “baulks” and runs as “aces.”

The laws were written when Adams presided over a gathering of 14 New York-area teams to revise the sport’s rules. Adams’s draft was transferred to more than a dozen separate pages in flowing script by William H. Grenelle, another Knickerbocker club official. Grenelle’s version reads like a scorecard of the convention debates, with pencil marks crossing out words and recording changes to Adams’s proposals. “Laws” was auctioned once before in 1999, by Sotheby’s, and sold for $12,650.
