What is Mr. Rosenthal mad about this week? “Voting rights, or the lack thereof, in the American South,” he said, who criticizes laws in North Carolina that restrict turnout. Why? “The effect of these laws is racist,” he said.

The worst recent news, according to Mr. Rosenthal? “Donald Trump just kicking butt all over the place.”

Last, the good news. And there is lots of it.

First, Mr. Rosenthal said, the country is getting rid of the “genocidal maniac” — Andrew Jackson — from the $20 bill and is replacing him with Harriet Tubman. Second, the world recognized the genius of Prince.

Then there was Beyoncé, creating the biggest cultural sensation of the year.

Susan Lehman is host.
