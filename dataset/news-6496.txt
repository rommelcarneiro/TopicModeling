SAN DIEGO — Drew Pomeranz and four relievers combined on a three-hitter, Jon Jay had three hits and an R.B.I., and the San Diego Padres beat the Mets in a second consecutive game, 2-0, on Friday night.

The Padres, who have been blanked eight times this year, pitched their first shutout of 2016. They have held the defending National League champion Mets to three runs and seven hits in the first two games of a four-game series.

Pomeranz (3-3) allowed only a single to Asdrubal Cabrera with two outs in the fourth while striking out five and walking three in five innings. His effort came a night after Colin Rea took a no-hitter into the seventh in a 5-3 Padres victory.

Noah Syndergaard (2-2) took the loss after allowing two runs and six hits in six innings. He struck out five and walked two.

Pomeranz threw 98 pitches as he ended a two-start losing streak.

Kevin Quackenbush threw a perfect sixth, Ryan Buchter allowed two hits in the seventh, and Brandon Maurer pitched a 1-2-3 eighth before Fernando Rodney pitched the ninth for his eighth save.

Jay doubled to left leading off the first and scored on Matt Kemp’s sacrifice fly. Jay singled with one out in the fifth to bring in Jemile Weeks, who drew a leadoff walk and stole second.

Jay also singled in the third.

In the seventh, the Mets’ Asdrubal Cabrera attempted to score from first on Wilmer Flores’s double into the left-field corner but was thrown out on a relay from Melvin Upton Jr. to shortstop Alexei Ramirez to Derek Norris. Norris was shaken up tagging out Cabrera but stayed in the game. The play was reviewed and upheld.
