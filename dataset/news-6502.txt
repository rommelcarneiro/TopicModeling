A teenager who raped a woman in Chinatown with two other boys after the three of them had escaped from a group home for juvenile offenders was sentenced to 15 years in prison on Friday in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, the district attorney’s office said.

The youth, Emanuel Burrowes, 17, had pleaded guilty to rape, robbery and burglary in connection with the assault. Justice Maxwell Wiley had promised a sentence between five and 15 years. In the end, he opted for the 15-year term recommended by prosecutors, citing the severity of the attack.

Mr. Burrowes and his co-defendants, Eric Pek and Sanat Asliev, admitted in court that they had beaten and raped the woman, 33, in an apartment stairwell on Eldridge Street early on the morning of June 1, after having accosted her in a nearby Internet cafe. All three were 16 years old last summer and had been living at a home for juvenile offenders in Brooklyn run by Boys Town. After the hourlong assault, they stole the victim’s cellphone, credit card and keys, and entered her apartment in Chelsea.

Mr. Pek was sentenced to 14 years last month; Mr. Asliev was scheduled to be sentenced on June 3. The home in Park Slope from which they escaped has been closed, and its employees are facing criminal charges.
