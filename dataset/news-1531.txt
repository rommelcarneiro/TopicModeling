MADRID — A baby born to Syrian refugee parents in Jordan last year has received approval to go to Spain to undergo emergency facial surgery, the family’s lawyers said Friday.

The baby girl, Sham Aldaher, was born last July without an eye and with a severely disfigured face. A Barcelona children’s hospital offered in March to perform the complex surgery required to repair her disfigurement, but bureaucratic hurdles have kept her from traveling to Spain.

Spain’s interior minister, Jorge Fernández Díaz, said the government decided to grant a travel visa on Thursday, shortly after The New York Times published an article about the baby’s plight.

Speaking in Barcelona on Thursday, the minister told Efe, the Spanish news agency, that Sham’s family was expected to stay in Spain only for the baby’s treatment at Sant Joan de Déu hospital in Barcelona.

Sham’s family — her parents and three siblings — fled Syria in 2013 and have been living as refugees in Jordan since then. They have received conditional approval to resettle in the United States, but their American applications are subject to background checks, with no date set for their completion, according to the family’s lawyers.

They have spent months trying to help Sham get medical treatment overseas. On Thursday, they say, the Spanish Embassy in the Jordanian capital, Amman, notified them that it had received authorization for special visas for Sham and her family. The process is still expected to take between eight and 12 days, as the family’s visas are open to review by Spain’s European partners under the Schengen rules.

Assuming there are no further bureaucratic hurdles, the family is expected to arrive in Barcelona later this month, said Jörn Halling, a German lawyer with Reed Smith who is working on Sham’s case.
