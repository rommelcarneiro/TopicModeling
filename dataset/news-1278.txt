A 5-year-old boy was in fair condition on Saturday after his mother wrested him from a mountain lion that had pounced on the child outside their home near Aspen, Colo., the police said.

The boy, whose name was not disclosed, was playing outside with his older brother around 8 p.m. on Friday when his mother, who was inside the house, heard screaming.

She ran outside and saw a mountain lion on top of her son, who sustained injuries to his face, head and neck during the attack, the police said.

The Pitkin County Sheriff’s Office said the woman “was able to physically remove her son” from the animal’s grip, sustaining injuries to her hands and legs. Her son was transferred to a hospital in Denver on Saturday, the sheriff’s office said.

The police did not say if the injuries sustained by the mother and her child were caused by scratches or bites. The Aspen Times reported on Saturday that the animal had bitten the child.

“She was able to pry the cat’s jaws open,” Michael Buglione, a sheriff’s deputy, told the paper. “She’s a hero.”

The authorities learned of the attack when the boy’s father called 911 as he drove his son to Aspen Valley Hospital on Friday, the sheriff’s office said. The attack happened in an unincorporated area of Pitkin County roughly 10 miles outside Aspen.

The sheriff’s office said deputies responded to the family’s home, along with a United States Forest Service officer, shortly after receiving the father’s 911 call. The Forest Service officer killed a mountain lion in the front yard.

Officers from Colorado Parks and Wildlife examined the dead mountain lion and searched for a second lion that had been reported in the area earlier that day.

Colorado Parks and Wildlife said in a statement on Saturday that lion sightings had increased across the state as a result of “a robust lion population” and development encroaching on their habitats. The last known attack on a human happened last July near the town of Dotsero.
