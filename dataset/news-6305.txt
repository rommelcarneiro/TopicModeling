Daniella Topol has been named the new artistic director of Rattlestick Playwrights Theater. She will replace David van Asselt, who has led Rattlestick since its inception in 1994.

Ms. Topol most recently directed “Ironbound” at Rattlestick in March. In his review for the Times, Charles Isherwood named the play a Critics’ Pick and praised Ms. Topol for directing with “economy and delicacy.”

Ms. Topol has directed and produced plays across the country, and has worked extensively with Women’s Project Theater. “What’s exciting and unique about Rattlestick is that we’re so committed to work that makes you lean in,” she said in an interview. “It’s work that is fierce and intense and brave.”

Ms. Topol said her goals for Rattlestick include championing new, innovative plays, forging connections with theaters outside New York, and developing the theater’s educational programs. “Rattlestick can be a great place to continue to give opportunities to young diverse artists to get their hands dirty,” she said.

Rattlestick’s next production, presented with the Colt Coeur theater company of Brooklyn, is “Cal in Camo” by William Francis Hoffman, directed by Adrienne Campbell-Holt.
