One of the least-known sources of modern realism will be honored Sunday, May 22, in Fort Worth, where the Kimbell Art Museum is opening “The Brothers Le Nain: Painters of Seventeenth-Century France.” Contemporaries of Velazquez and Georges de La Tour, the brothers — Antoine, Louis and Mathieu — were prominent in Paris in the 1630s and 1640s. Often signing their efforts simply Le Nain, they elevated genre painting with dignified depictions of peasants usually seated, motionless, in landscapes or plain interiors. Odd in scale, spatial illusion and gravity of mood, these images are fittingly painted in a solid, workmanlike style and are startlingly prescient of 19th-century French artists like Courbet and Manet. Collective anonymity has always seemed appropriate to the way the Le Nain brought painting down to earth, but this rare overview of 44 paintings — including less radical religious works — also presents new scholarship regarding which brother did what.
