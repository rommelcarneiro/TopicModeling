“The Boys in the Bunkhouse: Servitude and Salvation in the Heartland,” a nonfiction work about a very dark corner of the American employment landscape, is based on a series of New York Times stories by reporter Dan Barry.

Colum McCann, an award-winning author, says that Mr. Barry’s book, just out this month, “had to be written — the same way that Grapes of Wrath had to be written.” Going further, Mr. McCann says Mr. Barry is “the closest we have to a modern Steinbeck.”

Mr. McCann joins Mr. Barry in conversation about his book, written about dozens of intellectually disabled men kept in virtual servitude in a squalid farmhouse in Iowa, where they got out of bed every day — decade after decade — and eviscerated turkeys for $65 a month. The local community accepted and befriended the men, known as “boys,” but failed to notice obvious signs of their neglect, exploitation and the abuse they had endured. No one said anything for 30 years.

The case eventually led to the largest verdict in the history of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, calling for $240 million in damages, and had a big impact on disability rights in the workplace.

In this podcast, Mr. McCann explains how the book arose from a dare he made to Mr. Barry in a pub. “It’s such a great story. If you don’t write it, I will,” Mr. McCann told him. Mr. Barry is a Long Island man who says he takes dares seriously, and could not resist. Thus began “The Boys in the Bunkhouse.”
