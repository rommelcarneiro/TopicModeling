Leave it to Beyoncé to reinvigorate the idea of appointment television. Saturday night, her “Lemonade” special aired on HBO, followed immediately by the release of “Lemonade” the album on the streaming service Tidal. (It is now available for purchase on iTunes.)

For the second time she has, as she once sang, “stopped the world.” In the moment, and in the days that followed, there was little room for non-“Lemonade” pop discourse.

Which is fine, because “Lemonade” is bracing in several ways: reasserting the importance of focus in an Internet economy that prizes evanescence; placing the concerns of black women on the biggest pop stage; and upending years of public silence on the nature and state of the relationship between Beyoncé and her husband, Jay Z, by seemingly eviscerating him for his — alleged! — infidelities throughout the album (before arriving at what feels like hard-fought, but still unsteady, reconciliation).

On Monday afternoon, I joined Wesley Morris, critic at large for The New York Times, and Jenna Wortham and Nikole Hannah-Jones, staff writers at The Times Magazine, for a taping of the Popcast broadcast live on The Times Facebook page. We spoke about how Beyoncé has moved beyond genre and how she’s newly navigating her public image after years of remaining quiet. Also: what the world wants from Beyoncé, but more important, what Beyoncé wants from the world.
