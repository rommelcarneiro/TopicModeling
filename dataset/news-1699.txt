Grace Wales Bonner, the 25-year-old breakout star of the London men’s wear scene who has become known for collections that explore black culture and identity, has won the LVMH 2016 prize for emerging talent.

She is the third London-based designer, and the third graduate of Central Saint Martins in a row, to win the prize, which was introduced in November 2013.

Ms. Wales Bonner will receive a grant of 300,000 euros (about $335,000), plus a year of coaching and mentorship from LVMH executives, the French luxury group announced Thursday at a ceremony at the Louis Vuitton Foundation art museum in Paris.

The jury for the prize included Karl Lagerfeld, Marc Jacobs, Phoebe Philo and Jonathan Anderson. Ms. Wales Bonner was awarded the gold-star prize by Léa Seydoux, the French film actress and a brand ambassador for Louis Vuitton.

The prize, the most lucrative in the industry, is open to designers younger than 40 who have produced at least two ready-to-wear collections. This year, more than 1,000 applied.

Ms. Wales Bonner’s win was announced just days after she showed her spring 2017 collection at London Collections Men to broadly ecstatic reviews. The clothes — rich in narrative, as always — were inspired by the 1930 crowning of Haile Selassie as emperor of Ethiopia, and by traditional ceremonial dress used to push the boundaries of contemporary tailoring.

Finely tailored and gender fluid, Ms. Wales Bonner’s work was the subject of an exhibition, “Fashion in Motion,” at the Victoria and Albert Museum last year, when she won the British Fashion Council’s emerging men’s wear talent award.

The seven other finalists for the LVMH prize were: Aalto, by Tuomas Merikoski; Alyx, by Matthew Williams; Brandon Maxwell; Facetasm, by Hiromichi Ochiai; Koché by Christelle Kocher; Vejas, by Vejas Kruszewski; and Y/Project by Glenn Martens. Mr. Kruszewski, a young Canadian designer, was also awarded a special jury prize of €150,000, as well as a year of mentorship.
