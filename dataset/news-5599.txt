The hole at the center of New York hip-hop — the 1997 death of the Notorious B.I.G. — will be the implicit foundation for the Bad Boy Family Reunion, which is coming to the Barclays Center for a pair of sold-out shows. Bad Boy Records defined mainstream New York hip-hop in the 1990s and also helped create the template for the genre’s pop future — even if the label is far from its peak now, its lessons have been so assimilated as to be ubiquitous.

These shows will include performances by first-wave stars like Mase, Total, Faith Evans and the Lox; current artists like French Montana; 1990s stars with close ties, including Mary J. Blige and Lil’ Kim; and Jay Z, who in the mid-1990s was quietly vying for dominance with the Notorious B.I.G., and who absorbed his lessons on the way to multiplatinum genre dominance in the 2000s.
