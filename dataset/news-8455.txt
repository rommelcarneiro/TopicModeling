When the designer Gabriela Hearst first went to Tokyo in 2007, she says she felt immediately at home. Since then, she’s returned to the city multiple times — especially since she launched her eponymous label last year. “My collection is about the construction and the quality of materials,” says Hearst, who was born in Uruguay and currently lives in New York. “It’s more than a flat image; the garments are beautifully made and this idea of educated and edited consuming is something that the Japanese appreciate.” She and Stephanie de Lavalette, her best friend and the brand’s director of operations, recently spent four days in Tokyo, celebrating the spring 2016 line’s arrival at Barneys Japan, eating their fill of fish and indulging Hearst’s paper obsession. Here, she shares photos from their adventures around town.
