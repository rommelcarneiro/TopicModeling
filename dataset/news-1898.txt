WASHINGTON — A coalition of prominent social conservatives is banding together in an effort to nudge the Republican platform further to the right at the party’s convention next month.

The organizations involved include those that have been front and center in the culture wars over abortion and same-sex marriage like the Family Research Council Action, the March for Life and Concerned Women for America.

Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council and a platform committee delegate from Louisiana, said that while he expects the Republican Party to “remain committed to the core values of life, marriage, family and religious freedom,” there are new questions that need to be addressed because they have arisen in the four years since the platform was last revised. The 2012 platform, many Republicans believe, was one of the most conservative on record.

Over the last four years, a number of issues have surfaced that social conservatives say they want to see included in the platform. Those include the 2015 Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage, the passage of religious liberty legislation that allows businesses to refuse certain civil rights protections to gay and lesbian couples, as well as the recent debate over transgender rights.

Mr. Perkins said he also expects the platform to contain an explicit call to abolish the federal Department of Education.

A statement by the members of the newly formed coalition, which will include other platform committee delegates from Texas, Arizona and Oklahoma, said they will have “a strong policy presence in Cleveland to assist and advise delegates who are coalition members on a variety of public policy matters and platform committee procedures.”

The platform will be drafted and made final in the week before the July 18-21 Republican convention in Ohio.
