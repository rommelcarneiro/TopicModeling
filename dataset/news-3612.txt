NEW DELHI â€” A large fire erupted in a military ammunition depot in central India early on Tuesday, threatening adjacent villages and killing more than a dozen people.

The fire, on the outskirts of Pulgaon, a town about 370 miles northeast of Mumbai in the state of Maharashtra, started in a shed filled with ammunition, Lt. Gen. Ranbir Singh, the director general of military operations in the Indian Army, said in a televised statement from New Delhi on Tuesday afternoon. The army has ordered an inquiry.

The fire, which began around 1 a.m., had been completely doused, he said. At least 16 people died, including two officers, one enlisted soldier and 13 civilian firefighters, he said, and 17 were injured.

Dr. Purushottam Madavi, civil surgeon of the Wardha district in the northeast of the state, said that many victims were being treated in local hospitals for severe burns, abrasions and head injuries.

Some had perforated eardrums because of powerful explosions, said Dr. Luv Luthra, a doctor treating victims in the surgery ward of the Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College in Wardha.

Villagers were instructed to flee their homes in the early morning hours, said Shailesh Nawal, the district magistrate.

India has a history of deadly depot fires, which have been attributed to carelessness and lax safety standards.

A fire tore through a military facility in the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir in 2007, setting off a chain of explosions and causing artillery shells to fall into neighboring villages. Seventeen people died, and scores were injured.

Another fire, in Kolkata in 2010, destroyed tons of ammunition but did not result in any deaths.
