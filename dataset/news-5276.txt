This summer, a very Brooklyn pop-up bridges the gap between Mexico and New York with fresh tortillas filled with local ingredients. “We were talking about how in Mexico City there’s the street tacos that you’re worried might make you sick, and these gourmet places that are starting to pop up — but nothing in between,” says the artist and photographer April Valencia about the inspiration behind Josephina, a taco stand and market that opens this Friday in the backyard of the Pines, in the Gowanus neighborhood.

The idea came about when Valencia and the owner of the Pines, Carver Farrell, traveled from Mexico City to Oaxaca late last year. They’ve since tested many of Josephina’s recipes on friends — and begun sourcing ingredients from others. The ceviche, for example, stars fluke from a fisherman they know on Long Island, who brings in on Thursdays what he caught on Wednesdays. All the produce, meat and cheese is from upstate New York farms. Tortillas are made fresh daily with hand-ground corn. And the menu will feature rotating chef takeovers, with talent from as far as Copenhagen.

The market’s offerings will include New Age-inspired products from upstate — desert stones, indigo-dyed knits, tonics and elixirs — and freshly made foods from the taco stand, from salsas to “Gun Powders,” a super-food supplement made daily, to boost smoothies, tea or water. There are also new textiles from Valencia’s line, Native Kind, and everything will be available online beginning this June.
