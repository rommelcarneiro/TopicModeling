SAN FRANCISCO — Few men are as synonymous with the venture capital industry — the financiers who nurtured the likes of Apple, Google and Facebook — as Thomas J. Perkins, who died on Tuesday at the age of 84.

And over his decades-long career at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the firm he co-founded 44 years ago, the billionaire has helped build a number of technology giants.

Here are some of the investments he spearheaded:

■ Genentech One of the pioneers of the biotechnology industry, whose drugs include blockbuster treatments like Avastin and Herceptin.

Mr. Perkins, who was a longtime director of the drug maker, had described the company as one of his favorite investments, and Kleiner Perkins’s backing of Genentech has been described as important to the formation of the biotechnology field.

■ Tandem Computers A manufacturer of computers used in banks, A.T.M.s and other systems that prize reliability above nearly all else. The company said that its products were “fault-tolerant” and could run all the time, without stopping.

Tandem was incubated at Kleiner Perkins, and Mr. Perkins was the chairman of the company’s board for its 23 years of independence, until the computer maker was sold to Compaq in 1997.

■ LSI Logic A maker of computer chips, particularly those that control networks and especially storage for data centers based in the Bay Area. Mr. Perkins served on LSI’s board, including as lead director, for a long time. The company was acquired by Avago Technologies for about $6.6 billion in 2013.

■ Acuson A manufacturer of sonograph equipment, whose accomplishments include creating the first fully computerized ultrasound system. Mr. Perkins had served as a director of the company. Acuson was purchased by Siemens in 2000 for $700 million.
