Citing progress in moving homeless people off the street and into shelters, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Thursday that an annual survey had found a 12 percent drop in the number of people living without shelter in New York City compared with 2015.

On Feb. 9, hundreds of volunteers and officials, including Mr. de Blasio and Julián Castro, secretary of the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, fanned out across the city to count the number of people living on the street, in encampments and in the subway as part of the survey, which is required by the federal government. The count estimated that 2,794 people were living without shelter, a significant drop from 2005, when the survey’s estimate was 4,395, according to data the mayor’s office released on Thursday.

While Mr. de Blasio and some City Council members and shelter providers praised the announcement, advocates for homeless people have long questioned the credibility of the survey because of several variables, including the fact that the count takes place during the winter, when people are more likely to seek shelter.

The survey also does not include young homeless people, who are more likely to be transient, drifting from couch to couch, or turning all-hours coffee shops into de facto shelters.

Mary Brosnahan, president and chief executive of the Coalition for the Homeless, who is a longtime critic of the count and its methodology, said, “Anyone who believes that street homelessness has declined in New York City over the past year — let alone declined by double digits — should make sure their windows are closed and locked, because they’ll also be seeing dozens of pigs in flight later this afternoon.”

Mr. de Blasio, who spent much of last summer grappling with the growing number of people in shelters and the increased visibility of people panhandling on sidewalks and on the subway, said the city would begin conducting quarterly street homeless counts in May.
