Confronted with stiff competition from the N.B.A. playoffs, the premiere of the A&E mini-series “Roots” debuted to a total of 5.3 million viewers on Monday night.

Though that is nowhere near the number who watched the 1977 version of “Roots,” which set television ratings records, the audience on Monday represented the highest for a premiere of a scripted cable mini-series in three years.

“Roots” did not do as well as some of A&E Networks’ other big mini-series efforts in recent years. The final installment of the 2012 mini-series “Hatfields and McCoys” drew more than 14 million viewers and nearly 10 million people tuned in for the premiere of the 2013 mini-series “Bonnie & Clyde,” which, like “Roots,” was broadcast on A&E, History and Lifetime simultaneously.

The “Roots” revival received strong reviews, but it had a formidable opponent: Game 7 of the N.B.A. Western Conference finals. The game between the Golden State Warriors and the Oklahoma City Thunder had nearly 16 million viewers, a record breaker for a professional basketball game on cable.

The final three installments for “Roots” will be broadcast Tuesday through Thursday.
