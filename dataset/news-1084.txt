These biscuits, with that classic, sweetly metallic flavor, are puffy and square, as if one parent were a Parker House roll. They come from Guerneville in Sonoma County, Calif., where they brought fame to the Big Bottom Market, a tiny offshoot of which has opened on the Upper West Side. Order them with butter and jam, whipped cream and berries, pulled pork or even smoked salmon and crème fraîche, to enjoy from a sidewalk perch or to takeaway, from 7 a.m. to 2 p.m. on weekdays (8 to 11 a.m. weekends): biscuits $4 to $10 at Big Bottom Biscuit Bar, Osteria Cotta, 513 Columbus Avenue (85th Street), 212-873-8500, bigbottommarket.com/biscuit-bar-nyc/.
