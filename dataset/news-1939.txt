This collection of intense fruit squares, a confection the French call pâtes de fruits, is from Casey Hickey, a candymaker and chocolatier based in Charlotte, N.C., who studied in Paris. What makes them shine is the fruit she uses, mostly locally grown berries, along with passion fruit, kalamansi and sour cherries. They come in a clear box, lined up in a vibrant gradation of color: Twenty Degrees Chocolates pâtes de fruits, $20 for 12 pieces from mouth.com.
