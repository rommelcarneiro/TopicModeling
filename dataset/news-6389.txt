Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has cut into Hillary Clinton’s lead in the Democratic presidential race by more than two dozen delegates, based on new data from Washington State, while Mrs. Clinton won the Guam caucuses on Saturday.

Mr. Sanders handily won the Washington caucuses on March 26, taking 25 of the 34 delegates awarded that day. An additional 67 delegates could not be divided up until the state party released vote data broken down by congressional district.

District-level data provided to The Associated Press on Saturday showed that Mr. Sanders would pick up 49 of those delegates, while Mrs. Clinton would receive 18.

Still, even with the additional delegates, Mr. Sanders’s mathematical chances of winning the nomination have not improved.

Counting superdelegates, the party officials who are free to support whomever they like, and who have overwhelmingly backed Mrs. Clinton so far, she now has 2,229 delegates, or 94 percent of the total needed to win the nomination. Mr. Sanders has 1,453.

Guam’s Democratic Party said Mrs. Clinton had won 60 percent of the vote to earn four of the seven delegates at stake. The Pacific island is one of five United States territories that cast votes in primaries and caucuses to decide the nominee, even though those residents are not eligible to vote in November.

Often overlooked, Guam drew attention from both candidates, who ran radio advertisements in an effort to scoop up any possible delegates in the final stretch of primaries and caucuses.

The next primary contest will be held on Tuesday in West Virginia. More than 800 delegates will be awarded on June 7, when California, New Jersey and four other states hold nominating contests.
