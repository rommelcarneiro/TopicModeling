Stocks staged a late-afternoon rally to close moderately higher on Thursday, ending a five-day losing streak.

The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 6.49 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,077.99, and the Nasdaq composite rose 9.98 points, or 0.2 percent, to 4,844.91.

The Dow Jones industrial average rose 92.93 points, or 0.5 percent, to 17,733.10. It had been down more than 100 points earlier in the day.

Investors, who remained focused on next week’s vote on whether Britain will remain a member of the European Union, continued to shift money into assets considered less risky in times of volatility. High-dividend utility stocks rose nearly 1 percent. Gold also rose nearly 1 percent, and American government bond yields remained at lows not seen in four years.

“It’s all about de-risk right now, taking chips off the table,” said Rob Bernstone, a managing director and head of trading at Credit Suisse.

Overseas, Japanese stocks plunged 3 percent after the Bank of Japan once again voted not to further ease monetary policy to help the country’s faltering recovery. The Bank of Japan is pumping about 80 trillion yen ($769 billion) into the country’s economy each year with purchases of Japanese government bonds and other assets.

The yen jumped nearly 2 percent against the dollar, reaching its highest level in two years. Japanese officials have said they may intervene in currency markets if the yen appreciates too much.

As a result of Bank of Japan’s actions, the dollar fell sharply against the yen, trading at 104.32 yen compared with 106.01 the previous day. The euro fell to $1.1238 from $1.1251.

The price of benchmark crude oil sank $1.80 to $46.21 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, used to price international oils, shed $1.78 to $47.19 a barrel in London.

Energy stocks fell along with the price of oil. Transocean, Marathon Oil and Murphy Oil, all drilling or oil exploration companies, fell 3 to 4 percent each.

The entertainment conglomerate Viacom jumped sharply in the last hour of trading, closing up $2.85, or 6.8 percent, to $45.05, after National Amusements, controlled by Sumner M. Redstone, said it planned to replace five of Viacom’s 11 directors, including the chief, Philippe P. Dauman. The mental competency of Mr. Redstone, Viacom’s controlling shareholder, is being challenged in court.

In other energy trading, heating oil fell 5 cents, to $1.42 a gallon; wholesale gasoline fell 4 cents, to $1.47 a gallon; and natural gas fell 2 cents, to $2.58 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Gold rose $10.10, to $1,298.40 an ounce. Silver rose 10 cents, to $17.61 an ounce, and copper fell 4 cents, to $2.05 a pound.
