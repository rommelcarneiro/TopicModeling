From Penelope Skinner, the author of the well-received “The Village Bike,” seen in New York two years ago, comes the new play “The Ruins of Civilization.” Set in that ever-popular era — the future — the play concerns a couple, played by Tim Daly and Rachael Holmes, who are “living their married lives within the constraints and norms of a new world order,” as the news release cryptically puts it. Enter a mysterious guest, invited into their home by Ms. Holmes’s character in an impulsive act of charity that, perhaps not surprisingly, has unsettling results. Described as a thriller exploring our “need for free will and connection,” the play is directed by the Obie award winner Leah C. Gardiner for Manhattan Theater Club. (Now in previews and opening Wednesday, May 18, at City Center Stage II; 212-581-1212, nycitycenter.org.)
