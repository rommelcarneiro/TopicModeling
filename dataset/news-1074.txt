In politics, campaign shake-ups can be a sign of trouble or a sign of simple course correction.

In the case of Donald J. Trump’s decision on Monday to fire his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, there were a number of factors at play. Mr. Trump’s children, several donors and even the Republican National Committee had expressed a desire to see a change.

Mr. Lewandowski helped Mr. Trump in the primary race, in which he instinctively hit on the issues that the Republican base cared most about — ending free-trade deals, curtailing immigration and bringing an end to an interventionist foreign policy.

But that freewheeling style has not served him as well recently. And Mr. Lewandowski was, among other things, in charge of fund-raising for the campaign. At the end of May, Mr. Trump had just $1.3 million in cash on hand, compared with $42 million for Hillary Clinton.

Mr. Trump now has a chance to demonstrate a different aspect of his candidacy to the Republicans who have expressed interest in giving him a chance, including evangelical leaders who will meet with him on Tuesday.

And his top adviser, Paul Manafort, must staff a campaign, but with a bit of a freer hand, without a constant sense of internal chaos. Mr. Trump has opened the door to change — but to gain ground, he now must walk through it.
