A dispute over who is the legitimate owner of a Picasso bust of Marie-Thérèse Walter was settled in New York District Court on Monday, but the legal victor remains a mystery.

First reported by Bloomberg News, the settlement brings to a close a case in which two prominent collectors — the Qatari royal family and Leon Black, chairman of the Apollo private equity firm and co-chairman of the Museum of Modern Art — claimed to own the work, the plaster “Bust of a Woman.” All parties declined to comment on Tuesday, and the court has not disclosed any details.

The settlement, signed by Judge William H. Pauley, said: “These actions are discontinued without costs to any party, and without prejudice to reopening these actions if such an application is made within thirty (30) days of this order.”

The case involved several other prominent players in the art world, including the dealer Larry Gagosian, who said he had purchased the bust in May 2015 for about $106 million from Maya Widmaier-Picasso, the daughter of Picasso and Ms. Walter, then sold it to Mr. Black. Pelham Holdings, run by Guy Bennett, maintained in court documents that it had bought the work from Ms. Widmaier-Picasso in November 2014 for 38 million euros, or about $42 million.
