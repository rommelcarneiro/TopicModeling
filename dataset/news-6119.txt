Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams dined with George Washington at his first cabinet dinner on July 12, 1790, at the Morris-Jumel Mansion in Upper Manhattan. The house, the oldest in Manhattan, was built in 1765 and served as Washington’s headquarters in the fall of 1776. It is now owned by the city, and on July 10, it will bring that cabinet dinner to life with a menu that includes Martha Washington’s lettuce and plum tarts, asparagus ragoo, dressed fish rémoulade, sausages, great cake and cider. Joanna Pruess, a culinary anthropologist, is in charge of the cooking: July 10, 6 to 8 p.m., $100 a person, 212-923-8008, morrisjumel.org/upcoming-events.
