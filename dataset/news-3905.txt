The story in “Cleverman,” a six-part drama that begins Wednesday, June 1, on SundanceTV, is inspired by Australian Aboriginal folklore, but this unusual series has allegories relevant to just about anywhere. In the near future, a particular race is singled out for oppression and relegated to a sector known as “the Zone.” In this case, that race is known as the Hairies, a descriptive name indeed.

Some people view the treatment of Hairies as a human-rights atrocity, but the cultural resistance to equality is strong and ingrained: When a young Hairy dies during a police raid, the headline on the TV news reads, “Subhuman Minor Killed.” The series is a science-fiction story that soon becomes a superhero story — and this superhero is Aboriginal — that is drawing considerable attention in Australia, where racism toward indigenous populations is deep-seated.
