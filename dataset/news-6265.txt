David Villa and Khiry Shelton scored four minutes apart on Sunday as New York City F.C. defeated D.C. United, 2-0, in Washington.

It was the second straight win for N.Y.C.F.C., which improved to 3-3-4 and now sits in fourth place in the Eastern Conference.

Villa gave N.Y.C.F.C. the lead in the 49th minute by converting near the penalty spot on a back-heeled assist by Thomas McNamara. It was Villa’s team-leading seventh goal of the season.

In the 53rd minute, Shelton scored on a cross from Ronald Matarrita. United’s best chance occurred in the 61st minute, when Marcelo Sarvas’s free kick hit the post.
