A site-specific adaptation of “Julius Caesar,” a traveling hip-hop dance work and a video installation in Times Square by the British artist Tim Etchells are among the programs planned for the 10th annual Crossing the Line Festival this fall.

Presented by the French Institute Alliance Française, the interdisciplinary arts festival is scheduled to run from Sept. 22 through Nov. 3, at more than a dozen venues in Manhattan and the Bronx.

The New York premiere of “Julius Caesar. Spared Parts.,” adapted by the avant-garde Italian director Romeo Castellucci from the Shakespeare tragedy, will be staged Oct. 1 and 2 at Federal Hall in the Financial District. The production — a dreamlike meditation on power — has been described as “a suspension of reality” by Mr. Castellucci, who earned lifetime achievement honors from the Venice Biennale in 2013.

Also among the premieres is “Graphic Cyphers” (Sept. 23-25), a new hip-hop dance work by the breakdancer and choreographer Anne Nguyen that involves 20 New York City street dancers in the Bronx and Times Square. Other dance performances include “Staged” (Oct. 4-8) by Maria Hassabi, the inquisitive choreographer who turned dancers into slow-moving sculptures earlier this year with the installation “Plastic” at the Museum of Modern Art.

Mr. Etchells, the artistic director of the theater troupe Forced Entertainment and a recent winner of the Spalding Gray Award, will present his poetic multimedia installation “Eyes Looking” as October’s edition of the Midnight Moment in Times Square. As with other artworks in the series, “Eyes Looking” will take over many of the square’s billboards for a few minutes at midnight throughout the month. Forced Entertainment will also stage the New York premiere of its play “Tomorrow’s Parties” (Sept. 28-Oct. 1) as part of Crossing the Line.

The full lineup will be available soon at crossingtheline.org.
