The Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, renowned for its collection of postwar painting, announced that it had selected the architectural firm OMA to expand and refurbish the museum, an $80 million project and the largest ever undertaken by a cultural organization in Western New York.

The expansion, which has been under discussion for a decade, will be the first museum project in the United States by OMA, the firm founded by Rem Koolhaas, which has created some of the most distinctive buildings and interiors in the world over the last four decades. Shohei Shigematsu, a principal of the firm based in New York, will oversee the project. The firm was chosen after an international competition, and the decision was approved Monday night by a vote of the museum’s board.

“Over the next year, we will work together to imagine a renewed Albright-Knox for the twenty-first century, one that includes state-of-the-art spaces for special exhibitions and the display of our world-renowned collection,” said the museum’s director, Janne Sirén, in a statement.

The museum said the expansion was sorely needed because “a chronic shortage of space” has limited the display and preservation of its masterworks.

“Since the museum’s last expansion in 1962 the collection has quadrupled in size and now contains more than 8,000 works, only 200 to 300 of which can be shown at one time,” said the museum, which has been actively acquiring contemporary works since raising millions in 2007 through the de-accession of a collection of antiquities and medieval and Renaissance art, a decision that angered some museum patrons at the time.

The expansion project will be developed in close communication with the city and the museum’s neighbors, the museum said, to take a comprehensive view of the museum’s place “within Frederick Law Olmsted’s Delaware Park as a celebrated cultural resource in our region and as a vital contributor to Western New York’s resurgence.”
