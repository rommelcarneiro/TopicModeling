Democratic supporters of Hillary Clinton will be hoping that Tuesday, when the California primaries take place, will be the moment she can start looking forward to facing Donald J. Trump with a united front.

Republican supporters of Mr. Trump hope it will be the moment he stops looking backward and focuses on the November fight.

The Democratic primary in California is an opportunity for Bernie Sanders to argue to the party’s officials that he deserves their backing at the convention in July. If he loses to Mrs. Clinton, that argument will be more difficult to make. The Republican primary is effectively over, but Mr. Trump has marched on regardless.

Of the candidates, Mr. Trump is the one who should be having an easier time. After he vanquished his primary rivals and diminished “Stop Trump” movements, top Republicans in Congress backed him. Even some of his critics muted their commentary. But Mr. Trump has continued to pick at the scabs of the primary, while making criticisms of a prominent Hispanic Republican governor and of a federal judge overseeing a case against the defunct Trump University.

Mrs. Clinton said on Sunday that the moment would come, after Tuesday, for her to reach out to Mr. Sanders’s supporters. But Mr. Sanders is showing little sign of making such overtures. On Sunday, he directly criticized the Clinton Foundation and scoffed at suggestions the race would be over this week. On Sunday evening, Mrs. Clinton won the Puerto Rico primary, however, a victory that brings her closer to the number of delegates she needs to clinch the nomination.
