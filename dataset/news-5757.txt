SYDNEY — A private security contractor has been killed at the Australian Embassy in Baghdad, Australia’s foreign minister said on Friday.

Australian news media reported that the man had been shot, but a spokeswoman for the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, would not confirm that. “The circumstances surrounding his death will be thoroughly investigated,” she said in a statement.

The 34-year-old contractor, who was not identified, worked for Unity Resources Group, an Australian firm that provides security services at the embassy.
