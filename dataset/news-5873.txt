“The withered person with the scrambled mind marooned in a nursing home.” That, wrote the Times Metro reporter N.R. Kleinfield, is the familiar face of Alzheimer’s.

But Mr. Kleinfield wondered what the disease looked like in its early stages — just after diagnosis, and set out to find out. This involved following one woman — Geri Taylor, for almost two years — and was the subject of Mr. Kleinfield’s epic, 21,000-word article, “Fraying at the Edges.”

In an Insider piece on the origins of his reporting on Ms. Taylor, Mr. Kleinfield wrote that, after Ms. Taylor agreed to work with him, she told Mr. Kleinfield he “better be prepared to have fun.”

“Did we ever,” he wrote. How could that be? And how could Alzheimer’s provide one woman with a sense of purpose and the capacity to find pleasure in every moment?

In this podcast, Mr. Kleinfield explains and describes his reporting on a woman who talked about losing her ego as casually as she might mention having lost her keys, but who found herself feeling purposeful and alive to the beauty in all things.
