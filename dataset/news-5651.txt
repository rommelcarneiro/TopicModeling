Three people were killed when their pickup truck was struck by an Amtrak train at a rail crossing north of Fresno, Calif., on Friday, an Amtrak spokeswoman said.

The crash occurred around 12:30 p.m. as the train was traveling to Bakersfield from Oakland, the spokeswoman, Vernae Graham, said.

None of the 217 passengers or the three crew members aboard the train, the San Joaquin, Train 713, were injured, she said.

The three people who were killed were all inside the truck, she said. Names of the victims were not immediately available, and it was not clear if there were others inside the vehicle.

The crash occurred at a private railroad crossing alongside a vineyard in Gregg, Calif. The crossing had signs but no gates, Ms. Graham said.

Officer Josh McConnell of the California Highway Patrol said the truck’s driver pulled around a stopped freight train at a crossing on a private dirt road and was struck by the Amtrak train traveling on another set of tracks, The Associated Press reported.

The crash appeared to have happened, Officer McConnell said, because the freight train was blocking the main road and the truck’s driver followed a dirt road parallel to the tracks to find a way around it.

The locomotive involved in the crash sustained minor damage, Ms. Graham said.
