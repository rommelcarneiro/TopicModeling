Readers will swarm downtown Brooklyn for the 11th annual Brooklyn Book Festival on Sunday, Sept. 18, and we now know many of the authors they will be there to see. On Thursday, the festival announced nearly 200 of the 300 authors who will appear, including Margaret Atwood, Sherman Alexie, Russell Banks, Salman Rushdie and Joyce Carol Oates.

Those veteran boldface names will be joined by many emerging writers, including Nicole Dennis-Benn, Stephanie Danler, Angela Flournoy and Phil Klay.

As usual, the festival will include a strong international focus, with writers from Australia (Helen Garner), Chile (Lina Meruane), Denmark (Dorthe Nors), Israel (Sayed Kashua), Mexico (√Ålvaro Enrigue) and Nigeria (Okey Ndibe), among many other places.

The many panels, readings and performances that will compose the event have yet to be announced.
