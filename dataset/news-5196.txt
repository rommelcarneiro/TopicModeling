The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday that he believed the role of women in the military had expanded so broadly in recent years that they should be required to register for the draft just as men do.

Mr. McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, was quick to stress that he did not envision any return to the use of the Selective Service and believed that the volunteer, professional military had been “very successful.”

House Republicans had been contemplating an amendment to the annual military policy bill that would have required women to register for the Selective Service, but the Rules Committee on Monday dropped the amendment from consideration.

In recent months a number of senior military officials and influential members of Congress have expressed support for the idea.

It is unclear if the proposal will resurface, either during debate in the House or in the Senate version of the military policy bill. If it does, Mr. McConnell, as majority leader, certainly would hold some sway.

Asked for his opinion at a news conference on Tuesday, Mr. McConnell said: “First of all, I don’t anticipate going back to the draft. The professional voluntary Army has been very successful. We’re talking here about registration for Selective Service, should we ever go back to a draft. And given where we are today, with women in the military performing virtually all kinds of functions, I personally think it would be appropriate for them to register just like men do.”
