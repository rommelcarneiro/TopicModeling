The former heavyweight champions Mike Tyson and Lennox Lewis — as well as the actor Will Smith, who portrayed Muhammad Ali in the 2001 film, “Ali” — are among the pallbearers who will carry Ali’s coffin during funeral services Friday in Louisville, Ky.

The services for Ali, who died June 3rd at the age of 74, include a procession and private burial and a public memorial at the KFC Yum Center.

The other pallbearers are John Grady, Ali’s cousin; Ibn Ali, Ali’s nephew; Komawi Ali, Ali’s former brother-in-law; Jerry Ellis, brother of Jimmy Ellis, who was Ali’s former sparring partner and also a former heavyweight champion; Jan Wadell, Ali’s cousin; and John Ramsey, Ali’s family friend.

There will also be a number of honorary pallbearers for Ali’s funeral. The boxing legends George Foreman, who Ali famously beat in “The Rumble in the Jungle” in Kinshasa, Zaire in 1974, and Larry Holmes, who is one of only five boxers to beat Ali, will be joined by Mayor Harvey Sloane of Louisville, former Gov. John Y. Brown of Kentucky and Ali’s brother, Rahman Ali.
