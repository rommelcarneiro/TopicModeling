While savage inequities persist when it comes to opportunities for women as directors in Hollywood, there have been exceptions over the decades, if far too few. So thank Film Forum for its series “Genre Is a Woman,” continuing through Thursday, June 16, which honors auteurs who paved the way. Pioneers include the silent film director Alice Guy Blaché — her “Babies From Cabbages” (1902), “The Detective’s Dog” (circa 1912) and “The Pit and the Pendulum” (1913) screen on Sunday — and the indie favorite Kelly Reichardt, whose 2011 western “Meek’s Cutoff” screens on multiple days.

Also spotlighted: the director-producer-actress Ida Lupino (1918-1995), noted for taut suspense, whose “The Hitch-Hiker” (1953), a gritty noir surpassing similar efforts by her male contemporaries, comes Sunday and Monday. A vacationing family man (Frank Lovejoy) and a mechanic (Edmond O’Brien) pick up a psychopathic fugitive (William Talman, later the district attorney on “Perry Mason”), and a nasty cat-and-mouse game follows. A woman’s touch? No, just a great director’s. (212-727-8110, filmforum.org)
