When Conor McPherson’s “Shining City” ran on Broadway in 2006, it received some rapturous reviews — and two Tony Award nominations. Those of us unlucky enough to have missed Mr. McPherson’s haunting tale of urban isolation then are in luck now: The Irish Repertory Theater’s revival opens Thursday, June 9, in a production directed by Ciaran O’Reilly. Matthew Broderick stars as John, a grieving widower who visits a neophyte counselor (Billy Carter) for help dealing with the ghost of his wife.

The show is the first to be presented at Irish Rep’s newly renovated theater, which has undergone a significant transformation since work began in the fall of 2014. (An entertaining blog at campaign.irishrep.org shows the step-by-step progress.) (In previews, opening Thursday, June 9; 212-727-2737, irishrep.org.)
