Baylor University and its president and chancellor, Kenneth Starr, have increasingly come under fire as reports of former football players committing sexual misconduct have surfaced, and on Tuesday the university acknowledged the “rumors” and “speculation” surrounding Starr’s future.

The university said that its governing board was still considering the results of an investigation into the matter and that an announcement was expected by June 3.

The board “continues its work to review the findings of the Pepper Hamilton investigation,” the statement said, referring to the law firm commissioned last year to scrutinize how Baylor adjudicated and disciplined students, “and we anticipate further communication will come after the board completes its deliberations.”

Along with Starr, Athletic Director Ian McCaw and Coach Art Briles have faced criticism over the handling of the allegations.

Starr, a former solicitor general and federal judge, was the independent counsel who delivered a report that led to the impeachment of President Bill Clinton in 1998. Starr has been Baylor’s president since 2010, and the Bears have won two Big 12 championships since 2013 under Briles.

In 2015, the former football player Sam Ukwuachu was convicted of sexually assaulting a Baylor soccer player. Soon after, Starr recommended the board hire outside counsel to complete an independent investigation.

Subsequent reports from the ESPN show “Outside the Lines” have uncovered other accusations, including one against two players whom Baylor did not investigate for more than two years.

Two years ago, the former player Tevin Elliott was convicted of sexually assaulting a Baylor freshman. Last month, the former defensive end Shawn Oakman was arrested on a sexual assault charge, and a police report surfaced detailing a 2013 domestic assault accusation against him. A reporter at a site published by Rivals.com reported that the university knew of the allegation.
