The sculptor Ken Price’s celebrated, oozy abstract pieces in glazed or painted clay can bring to mind Kurt Vonnegut’s description of little green aliens: “The creatures were friendly, and they could see in four dimensions. They pitied Earthlings for being able to see only three.”

“Ken Price: Drawings,” an exhibition opening Thursday, May 5, at the Matthew Marks Gallery, reveals an often-unseen aspect of Mr. Price’s career: his opulent, sometimes darkly comic work in two dimensions. The show brings together more than 40 drawings, never before exhibited, from his studio in Taos, N.M.

Dating from the beginning of his career in 1960 through 2011 (he died in 2012), they include working drawings of his sculptures, along with quietly cockeyed views of the world, like a candy-colored, idyllic scene of a car plunging from a seaside cliff toward a busy freeway below.
