Chance the Rapper and Drake, according to Jon Caramanica, can both be explained via their triangulation with Kanye West. Drake seems to look at Mr. West as a model for emotional projection and for getting over in the business of culture; Chance sees him as a spiritualist in progress. On this week’s popcast, we talk about both their recent records: Chance the Rapper’s third mixtape, “Coloring Book,” released on May 12 for streaming by Apple Music, which is full of realism, joy and gospel; and Drake’s latest album, “Views,” released a little earlier, full of top-dog wariness.
