Stocks fell Friday as health care and technology companies continued to report weak first-quarter results, but late buying allowed them to avoid major losses.

Stocks opened lower and fell further throughout the morning, extending a downturn from the day before. That followed a rout in European indexes.

Late in the day, bond prices rose again, sending yields lower and pushing investors to buy utility and phone company stocks.

Dan Suzuki, senior United States equities strategist at Bank of America, said investors did not like what they were seeing in the results from technology companies. He said investors were turning to bondlike stocks, like phone and utility companies, and small- and midcap stocks, which struggled in 2015.

“Everything that was working through last year has been an underperformer this year, and vice versa,” he said.

The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 10.51 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,065.30. The Nasdaq composite index lost 29.93 points, or 0.6 percent, to 4,775.36, in its seventh consecutive decline.

The Dow Jones industrial average declined by 57.12 points, or 0.3 percent, to 17,773.64. It was down as much as 178 points earlier in the day.

Health care companies had the biggest losses after several weak earnings reports. The biotech drug maker Gilead Sciences said its results were hurt by big discounts and rebates on its costly hepatitis C medicines, and its stock lost $8.79, or 9.1 percent, to $88.21. The biotech giant Amgen reported relatively solid results, but its shares fell $2.26, or 1.4 percent, to $158.30.

The health insurer Molina Healthcare slashed its full-year guidance because of higher medical costs in Ohio and Texas, expenses related to recent acquisitions, and pharmacy costs, especially in Puerto Rico. It plunged $12.46, or 19.4 percent, to $51.76.

Cepheid, a molecular diagnostics company, lost $6.86, or 19.4 percent, to $28.54 as analysts were disappointed with its revenue projections for the second quarter.

Tech stocks continued to slide. After its profit fell short of estimates, the electronic storage company Seagate Technology lost $5.13, or 19.1 percent, to $21.77. Western Digital, a hard drive maker, dropped $5.19, or 11.3 percent, to $40.87. Apple, which is in a deep two-week slide, fell a further $1.09, or 1.2 percent, to $93.75. Like the Nasdaq, Apple has fallen for seven consecutive days.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.84 percent from 1.82 percent. Utility companies made the biggest gains, as NextEra Energy added $1.11, or 1 percent, to $117.58.

While earnings hurt technology and health care companies, better results at consumer companies sent those stocks higher. Amazon said its revenue jumped 28 percent in the first quarter, and the company turned a far bigger profit than analysts had expected. The cloud-based Amazon Web Services performed well. Amazon shares rose $57.59, or 9.6 percent, to $656.59.

The consumer products maker Newell Brands gave a strong outlook for the year after its reported solid results in the first quarter, and its stock rose $2.12, or 4.9 percent, to $45.54.

Expedia, an online travel company, reported a bigger adjusted profit and greater sales than expected, and its stock added $8.86, or 8.3 percent, to $115.77.

Rovi, a digital television listing company, said it would buy the digital video recording company TiVo for about $1.1 billion in cash and stock. TiVo gained shares 56 cents, or 5.9 percent, to $9.98 and Rovi rose 27 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $17.62.

Stocks in Europe took big losses. Official data showed the eurozone economy rose by a surprising 0.6 percent in the first quarter, but investors were concerned that inflation slipped in April. France’s CAC 40 fell 2.8 percent and Germany’s DAX lost 2.7 percent. Britain’s FTSE 100 shed 1.3 percent.

The yen continued to gain strength, as it has done over the last few months. It jumped Thursday after the Bank of Japan held off on any new economic stimulus measures. On Friday the dollar fell to 106.37 yen from 108.01 yen. Japanese markets were closed for a holiday Friday. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index fell 1.5 percent and Seoul’s Kospi gave up 0.3 percent.

Metals prices continued to rise. Gold advanced $24.10, or 1.9 percent, to $1,290.50 an ounce and silver rose 23 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $17.82 an ounce. Gold is trading at 15-month highs. Copper picked up 5 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $2.28 a pound.

Benchmark United States crude lost 11 cents to $45.92 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, fell 1 cent to $48.13 a barrel in London.

In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline lost 1 cent to $1.58 a gallon. Heating oil fell 3 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $1.38 a gallon. Natural gas rose 10 cents, or 4.8 percent, to $2.18 per 1,000 cubic feet.

The euro rose to $1.1448 from $1.1354.
