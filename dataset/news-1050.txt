Victoria and David Beckham have joined the chorus of British fashion insiders who are just saying no to Brexit, as Britain’s proposed departure from the European Union is called. The industry, after a period of silence, is becoming increasingly vocal in its support of the government’s “Remain” campaign as the deciding referendum on Thursday approaches.

On Tuesday, Ms. Beckham posted an “IN” logo on Instagram and a statement declaring her belief that Britain would be better off if it remained in the E.U. The post came in response to efforts by the “Leave” side to use an interview that the Spice Girls, Ms. Beckham’s former band, gave to the Spectator in 1996 in which Ms. Beckham criticized the then-new E.U. passports (among other things).

The “Leave” side quoted her as saying Europe was destroying Britain’s national identity, and captioned it, “Should’ve listened to the missus, David.” It referred to a “Remain’’ post earlier in the day by her husband, who has a deal with Global Brands to introduce his own men’s wear line.

Clearly Ms. Beckham’s position has changed in the last 20 years (maybe growing up, starting a family and opening a global business has something to do with it). In any case, the “Leave” campaign’s tactic appears to have backfired, as it prompted the designer’s decision to declare that she would vote with the “Remain” camp and encourage her followers to join her.

The Beckhams are among the most high-profile fashion designers, along with Christopher Bailey of Burberry and Patrick Grant, to take a public stance on the vote.

On Tuesday, a few hours after their posts, Ms. Beckham’s message had garnered 47,700 likes and 707 comments, and Mr. Beckham’s had 372,000 likes and 3,134 comments, which ranged from the supportive to those who felt the couple was too insulated by their wealth and success to understand the concerns of the “Leave” campaign.
