A new music festival is coming to Queens and it includes a Kanye West rain check.

The rapper, whose appearance at Governors Ball earlier this month was scrapped because of weather, will instead headline the inaugural Meadows Music and Arts Festival scheduled for Oct. 1 and 2 at Citi Field. The Weeknd, Chance the Rapper, Grimes, Bryson Tiller, Kamasi Washington and Kygo are also included on the bill.

Tickets go on sale at TheMeadowsNYC.com on Thursday, at 11 a.m. A two-day general admission pass costs $230, with V.I.P. versions available for $495 and $1,600.

The Meadows — which also promises “civic engagement with the Queens communities surrounding the event” — will be presented by Founders Entertainment, the once-scrappy promoters behind Governors Ball, that rare New York pop festival that has shown staying power. Live Nation, the concert and ticketing giant, acquired a majority stake in Founders Entertainment earlier this year.

For Mr. West, the gig will come amid his “Saint Pablo” tour of North America, which begins in late August.

Also in New York the same weekend as the Meadows will be the Roots Picnic in Bryant Park, featuring D’Angelo, John Mayer, Wu-Tang Clan, David Byrne and Nile Rodgers. And even closer, also at the Flushing Meadows-Corona Park complex that houses Citi Field, there is Maker Faire, a popular science carnival whose organizers are already mourning the loss of the parking lot to the Meadows festivalgoers. The promoters behind Coachella will also be hosting the inaugural Panorama festival on Randalls Island in July.
