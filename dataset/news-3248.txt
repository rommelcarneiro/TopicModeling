The San Francisco-based florist Christina Stembel founded Farmgirl Flowers as a corrective measure for the ills of a modern industry. Eighty percent of the flowers sold in the U.S. are imported, which perpetuates tons of waste and terrible working conditions in developing nations — not to mention droopy flowers that have been in transit for 8 to 10 days by the time they reach stores. Farmgirl sources all of its flowers domestically, so when they’re delivered to addresses nationwide they’re much fresher. (Adorably, the bouquets are also packaged in burlap repurposed from coffee sacks.)

Generally, Stembel eliminates the burden of choice: Her team picks and assembles the very best blooms that day, and the customer picks only the size of the bouquet. Now, though, there’s another option — of-the-moment peonies, available for a limited time while they’re in season. If you can’t get outside to enjoy the late-spring sunshine, they’re the next-best thing.
