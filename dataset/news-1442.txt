After the Tony Awards, Broadway gets quiet, as shows announce closing notices and openings become scarce. But a distinctive screeching sound around Times Square will raise the volume in the area for at least a night, when Gilbert Gottfried performs at Carolines on Thursday, June 23.

With a career in comedy that spans four decades, Mr. Gottfried has done just about everything: reality shows, roasts, “Saturday Night Live,” movies with Andrew Dice Clay (and one with Disney). He is perhaps most famous for crossing the lines of good taste, in his epic joke in the documentary “The Aristocrats” or when he told what the columnist Frank Rich wrote “may have been the first public 9/11 gag.”

He rarely does stand-up sets in the city, but when he does, it’s usually at Carolines, where he shows off his creative, filthy and utterly singular mind. In a superb profile, the critic Jay Ruttenberg wrote that his stand-up evokes the stars of the old borscht belt. “It is their anarchic sensibility that Gottfried covets, reveres, and upholds,” he wrote. “Of the fabled funny old men, he is the youngest.” (212-757-4100, carolines.com.)
