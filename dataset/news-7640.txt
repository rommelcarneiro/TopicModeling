The man accused of fatally shooting his wealthy father in 2015 made a rare appearance in a Manhattan courtroom on Wednesday, as his lawyer requested another psychological exam.

The man, Thomas S. Gilbert Jr., a 31-year-old Princeton graduate, faced ahead during the proceeding, not once turning to look at his mother, Shelley Gilbert, who sat in the second row — the closest she was allowed. Ms. Gilbert has not missed a court date since her son was arrested in the death of her husband, Thomas S. Gilbert Sr., 70, a hedge fund founder, who was shot in the head.

Alex Spiro, Mr. Gilbert’s lawyer, said his client had unsuccessfully tried to reach the president of Cablevision and believed he was being radioactively poisoned by a battery. Mr. Spiro asked that his client be retested for competency.

But the prosecution objected. “I think a little bit of perspective is in order,” said Craig Ortner, an assistant district attorney, adding that the request could lead to an “endless cycle” of competency tests and hearings.

Judge Melissa Jackson granted the request and ordered two new psychiatrists to examine Mr. Gilbert. She cited Mr. Spiro’s trouble communicating with his client, as well as a letter this week from a psychiatrist, which said Mr. Gilbert was having trouble communicating with him.

Mr. Gilbert typically refuses to enter the courtroom. However, he frequently writes to the judge.

The new psychological evaluation typically takes about six weeks, Judge Jackson said. Court will convene again on June 14 to review the report.
