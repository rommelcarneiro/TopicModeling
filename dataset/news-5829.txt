The actress Sheridan Smith has taken a leave of absence from the West End production of “Funny Girl,” the production’s publicists said Thursday, citing “stress and exhaustion” as the reasons for her departure.

“Funny Girl” started its run at the Menier Chocolate Factory, and after strong sales, transferred to the West End in April. Ms. Smith earned wide praise for her performance in the role of Fanny Brice, a character that is strongly identified with Barbra Streisand, who played the part on Broadway and on the screen.

In recent months Ms. Smith had drawn media attention for missing several performances of the show, and for a widely reported series of Twitter posts in which she seemed to voice frustration over personal issues. “U know when u suddenly realise U’re just a puppet,” read one post in February, according to The Telegraph. (Ms. Smith’s Twitter account has been made private.)

She pulled out of several performances this week. When The Daily Mail suggested that she had missed Monday’s performance because she had lost out on a television BAFTA award on Sunday, Ms. Smith voiced her frustration in tweets directed at the media.

The production’s publicist issued a statement on Thursday that read: “Sheridan Smith will be taking leave of absence from Funny Girl, due to stress and exhaustion. The entire team at Funny Girl is thinking of Sheridan, and know she is getting the rest and support she needs during this very difficult and stressful time.”

Ms. Smith will be on leave for two to four weeks, the statement said. The actress Natasha J. Barnes will temporarily replace her in the role.
