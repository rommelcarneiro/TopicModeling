For the season, the bar that opens onto the sidewalk at the restaurant Quality Italian features sgroppino, the Italian refresher usually made with lemon sorbetto, vodka and prosecco. But Bryan Schneider, who is in charge of the bar, has come up with several riffs on the classic. Cucumber-mint; blood orange; strawberry and black pepper; and mango, lime and Calabrian chile, all $12, are the inaugural choices, in a rainbow of pastel shades dictated by the flavor of the sorbetto. None are too sweet: Quality Italian, 57 West 57th Street (entrance on Avenue of the Americas), 212-390-1111, qualityitalian.com.
