LONDON — The investment firm General Atlantic said on Monday that it had agreed to acquire a majority stake in Argus Media in a deal that valued the London-based commodity price reporting agency at nearly 1 billion pounds, or about $1.4 billion.

Adrian Binks, the Argus executive chairman and publisher, will continue to be a part of the business and “retain the majority of his significant shareholding” in the business, alongside General Atlantic, the companies said.

The family of Argus founder, Jan Nasmyth, will sell their stake in the company and employees who are shareholders will be given an opportunity to reinvest in Argus, the companies said. Mr. Nasmyth died in 2008.

“Argus is an ideal fit with General Atlantic’s philosophy of supporting entrepreneurs to build global growth businesses,” Gabriel Caillaux, a General Atlantic managing director, said in a news release. “Argus’ data are absolutely essential for its customers’ day-to-day operations and the company’s recent technology investments position it well within its market.”

The deal is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to be completed within two months.

Mr. Caillaux and John Bernstein of General Atlantic will join the Argus board of directors after the transaction is completed.

Argus was founded in 1970 as a weekly newsletter covering the petroleum markets in the Netherlands. The company has 750 full-time employees and more than 160 publications.

“Argus will remain independent, focused on reporting commodities and continuing to bring transparency to opaque and vital markets,” Mr. Binks said.
