BORDEAUX, France — After a poor start to the European Championships, Belgium began living up to its promise on Saturday with a resounding 3-0 victory over Ireland.

Romelu Lukaku scored two second-half goals as Belgium’s vaunted attack finally sprang to life after a disappointing display in the opening 2-0 loss to Italy.

“I’m very happy for the team, you know,” Lukaku said. “I think it was very important for us to win today, to deliver a good performance after the game against Italy, which was a setback.

“Sometimes you need a setback, because we have a young squad. It’s good because we faced the reality. We knew that Italy’s a good side; they showed it against us. Now we are awake and have to become even better after the performance of today.”

Having earlier wasted a series of chances, Belgium — one of the tournament favorites — started the second half strongly and it was not long before the team went ahead.

Lukaku struck in the 48th minute after a swift counterattack. Axel Witsel doubled the lead with a header in the 61st, and Lukaku sent a pass from Eden Hazard past Ireland goalkeeper Darren Randolph in the 70th minute.

Belgium now has three points from its two games in Group E, while Ireland has one. Belgium plays Sweden next, and a draw would most likely seal the team’s qualification to the round of 16.

Ireland meets Italy, which has now won the group. Ireland will probably need to beat Italy to stand a chance of advancing.

“We have a game to win and we have to throw everything into it,” its coach, Martin O’Neill, said.

In the 24-team format that is being used at Euro 2016 for the first time, four third-place group teams will qualify for the round of 16.
