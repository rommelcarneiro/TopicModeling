One person was killed and three others were injured in a shooting near a high school in the Dorchester neighborhood on Wednesday afternoon, the Boston Police Department said.

The Boston police commissioner, William Evans, said that the person who was killed was a 17-year-old student at Jeremiah E. Burke High School.

Myeshia Henderson, a spokeswoman for the department, said that two other people, both in their late teens, had suffered injuries that were not life-threatening. A woman in her 60s was treated for a graze wound at the scene, Ms. Henderson said.

At an afternoon news conference, Commissioner Evans said the police were canvassing the neighborhood door to door in a search for the suspect or suspects.

Asked if the shooting was gang-related, Mr. Evans said it was too early to tell.

“We don’t know if it was a fight that was spilled out,” he said. “Kids don’t fight anymore with their hands, they run and get weapons.”

Mayor Martin J. Walsh, standing with Mr. Evans, said that trauma counselors would be sent into the school Thursday to help students and teachers cope with what happened.

“The victim is too young to be gunned down at the middle of the daytime, and the community is sick and tired of the shootings,” Mayor Walsh said.

Ali Guevara, 18, a senior at the school, was at a Burger King nearby when the shooting took place. She said that she heard shots, and that a friend told her the shooting took place after someone at the school pulled a fire alarm, an account repeated by several other students to local television reporters.

Mr. Evans said he understood that a fire alarm had been pulled at the school but had “no clue” whether it was related to the shooting.
