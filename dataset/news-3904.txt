Two years ago, Matt Wilson, a leading jazz drummer, lost his wife, Felicia — a violinist and orchestra teacher, mother to their four children — to leukemia. Reeling with grief, he convened some of his closest collaborators for a series of spirited sessions in her honor. The result is “Beginning of a Memory,” an earnest and upbeat album just out on Palmetto. Credited to Matt Wilson’s Big Happy Family, it features past and present members of his three main bands: Arts & Crafts, his quartet and Christmas Tree-O. The repertory similarly honors a retrospective urge, with pieces from across his 20-year recording career: “Schoolboy Thug,” a punkish favorite of Felicia’s, follows a more recent staple, “Feel the Sway.”

Those pieces are likely to resurface on Tuesday, May 31, when most of Mr. Wilson’s expanded ensemble appears at the Jazz Standard. Among the musicians is the trumpeter Terell Stafford, who plays with a solemn beauty on “Flowers for Felicia,” the album’s most poignant ballad. (7:30 and 9:30 p.m., jazzstandard.com.)
