The Transat bakerly is a one-person-sailboat race from Plymouth, England, to New York City — 3,000-plus nautical miles across an often-unforgiving sea. Which is to say, it’s a piece of cake for the first week. Then comes the second. “You’re one week alone, you’re tired, and now beginning the hard conditions,” said Thibaut Vauchel-Camus, 37, who competed in the race this year for the first time, leaving Plymouth at 2:30 p.m. on May 2 on what would be a 17-day-12-hour-and-42-minute sprint to victory in his class. His 40-foot-long boat, the Solidaires en Peloton-Arsep, was built more for speed than for comfort.

“By the second week it’s cold and wet, with strong winds and crossing waves,” Mr. Vauchel-Camus said, speaking from his home near Mont Saint-Michel in France. “You’re getting damage to your sail, your rudder, your electronics, and you need to find solutions to fix it under bad conditions. You’re fighting with the weather, fighting with the boat, fighting to fix it. In the second week, I lost all my instruments.”

He learned to sleep in intervals of about 20 minutes and — this being 2016 — to use his satellite Internet connection to upload selfies and videos of his exertions. Finally, after two and a half weeks, the New York skyline came into view. He knew he was the first to reach the finish line. “It was something like liberation,” he said. “The ocean is finished. The problem is finished. I arrived by night. It was a special thing to see all the New York lights. It’s not the same thing as when you arrive by day. You have a mystery. You know it is New York, but you don’t see it well. It’s a good feeling.” His nearest competitor was 66 miles behind him. “Now I go for a short sleep in my bed,” he said, not long after returning home on Tuesday. “And tonight I’ll take a glass of wine with friends.”
