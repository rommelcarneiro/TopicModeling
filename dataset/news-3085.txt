Martha Rosler, the Brooklyn artist who four years ago turned the Museum of Modern Art’s atrium into a mammoth garage sale, has also focused on social issues within cities.

“If You Lived Here …,” her 1989 three-show cycle at the Dia Art Foundation, explored gentrification, homelessness and urbanism through artworks, films, videos, fliers and other documents. Now Mitchell-Innes & Nash will revisit that exhibition, turning its gallery over to a new group calling itself the Temporary Office of Urban Disturbances.

The show, “If you can’t afford to live here, mo-o-ove!!,” which opens Tuesday, June 7, will include original material from Ms. Rosler’s cycle as well as public panels and discussions. (Through July 9; 212-744-7400, miandn.com.)
