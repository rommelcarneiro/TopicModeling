Darren Criss, the actor and singer best known for his role on “Glee,” will once again play the title role in “Hedwig and the Angry Inch,” this time on the West Coast.

Mr. Criss played “Hedwig” on Broadway for three months last year. He will now open the show’s national tour, first in his hometown, San Francisco, at the SHN Golden Gate Theater, in October, and then in Los Angeles, at the Hollywood Pantages Theater, in November. The tour will then continue around the country; casting for other cities has not yet been announced.

“Hedwig,” a rock musical about an East German singer whose sex-reassignment surgery went awry, features a book by John Cameron Mitchell and music and lyrics by Stephen Trask. The musical began its life with Off Off Broadway and Off Broadway runs, and then was adapted into a film, before making its way to Broadway in 2014; it won that year’s Tony award for best musical revival.
