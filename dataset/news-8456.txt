The photographer Pete Voelker has a widely diverse portfolio: He’s shot everything from portraits of musicians to still lifes to reportage, and his most recent work has taken him all over the country documenting political rallies and the presidential campaign trail. “Photography acts as a vessel for me,” Voelker says. “When I was younger, it was the only excuse I had to pack up and drive across the country or go on any sort of aimless adventure to see something new. Taking photographs is always the objective, but the journey to create photographs and the conversations with people along the way are what drive me as a photographer.”

Voelker, raised in Southern Maryland, first went to rallies during his frequent trips to Washington, D.C. while still in high school. It wasn’t until over a decade later, though, after attending marches for Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown in 2014, that he was inspired to shoot political events for both his personal and professional work. Voelker’s photographs focus on small, human moments rather than the grand narrative sweep of an election or social movement — he elegantly highlights the off-kilter details, as well as the human spirit, that can easily get lost in the madness. “I try to look for both the outspoken and the observers,” Voelker explains of his process. “There is a lot that goes on at political rallies, marches and demonstrations. From the literal production of the event to the organizing of ideas, there are many spinning wheels. I honestly obsessively try to cover everything when I’m at an event, but I’m most often drawn to the quieter, more ambivalent images in the end.”
