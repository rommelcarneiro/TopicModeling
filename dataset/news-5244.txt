LONDON — The British government said on Tuesday that it remained committed to selling a stake in the Lloyds Banking Group to retail investors, and to exiting its holdings in the lender by next year.

Harriett Baldwin, the economic secretary to the Treasury, said the government, which has a 9.2 percent stake in the bank, would offer some of its holdings to retail investors this year.

The government took a stake in the lender after it provided a bailout of 17 billion pounds, or $24 billion at current exchange rates, to Lloyds during the financial crisis.

On Tuesday, Lloyds paid a dividend of £130 million to the government, bringing the total the government has recovered to more than £16.8 billion.

The government delayed a sale to retail investors in January because of turmoil in the financial markets, the second delay since 2014.

“I am determined to build on this success by making Lloyds shares available to the public this year,” Ms. Baldwin said in a news release, “so that we can build a share-owning democracy and continue to reduce our national debt.”

The Treasury said it expected to have fully sold off its Lloyds holdings this year or next.

The government owned more than 40 percent of Lloyds after the bailout, but it has reduced its holdings as the bank’s prospects have improved.

Since October, when the government announced plans for a retail offering, the Lloyds share price has fallen 13 percent, and the stock is now trading at an average below the 73.6 pence a share the British government had paid.

Shares of Lloyds rose about 1 percent to 67.30 pence in afternoon trading in London on Tuesday.
