Recipes in the Culinary Institute of America’s new cookbook for children are not dumbed down. Pizza starts with dough, not an English muffin. And the book opens with good habits for kitchen safety — for the food as well as the chef. (It is recommended for children ages 10 to 14, but an adult who has never really cooked could learn a few lessons, too.) This bright and engaging book explains equipment, knife work, cooking methods and how to taste and create flavor. Sidebars headed “Think Like a Chef” offer variations and tips, and strewn throughout are notes about ingredients and their histories: “The Young Chef: Recipes and Techniques for Kids Who Love to Cook,” by Mark Ainsworth and the Culinary Institute of America (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $23, paperback).
