The Barney Brown website invites you to create a virtual sandwich for real delivery, offering scores of illustrated components for you to assemble interactively: 10 types of bread; eight different meats and tuna, chicken or egg salad; 10 cheeses; and assorted toppings including arugula, olives, pesto, cucumbers and alfalfa sprouts. As you add each element, your sandwich takes shape on the screen, and the price changes accordingly. Matt Baer, a founder of the mini-cupcake chain Baked by Melissa, is behind the service and has the sandwiches prepared in Chelsea. There are no set combinations, though popular sandwiches that others have assembled are featured. For now, delivery is available from 14th to 42nd Streets, river to river: $10 minimum, barneybrown.com.
