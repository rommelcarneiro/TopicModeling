Good evening. Here’s the latest.

1. Donald J. Trump swept the primary elections in five states — Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island — according to The Associated Press. On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton was poised to pick up a significant number of delegates in Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Maryland and Delaware, dealing a blow to Bernie Sanders, whose sole victory was in Rhode Island.

2. Apple reported its first down quarter in 13 years, suggesting iPhone saturation in some countries. Sales fell fastest in China, which is grappling with an economic downturn. But the company still generates tens of billions of dollars of cash every year, and said it was increasing its dividend. Apple’s stock price fell in after-hours trading.

Outside of tech, U.S. stocks finished slightly higher, as benchmark crude oil rose to $44.04 a barrel, lifting energy companies. The price of gold rose $3.20 to $1,243.40 an ounce.

3. The founder of Chobani, the yogurt maker that shook up the dairy case with its thick, Greek-style recipe, surprised his 2,000 full-time employees with shares worth up to 10 percent of the company. “I’ve built something I never thought would be such a success, but I cannot think of Chobani being built without all these people,” said Hamdi Ulukaya, a Turkish immigrant.

4. The top U.S. intelligence official, James Clapper, warned this week that the Islamic State is operating clandestine cells in Britain, Germany and Italy. At the same time, European security services are in a quandary over how to handle the hundreds, possibly thousands, of young men who have gone to Syria to join ISIS, but come back claiming to disavow the group.

5. Sorting out Prince’s estate isn’t going to be easy, and not just because he kept such a tight grip on his business matters. In newly filed court documents, his sister said that he died without a spouse or children and that “I do not know of the existence of a will.” The documents list five other interested parties: three half brothers and two half sisters.

_____

6. The Senate is near a deal for at least $1.1 billion to fight the Zika virus, but the measure faces resistance from House Republicans. Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader, said the Obama administration had not answered relevant questions, but Democrats blamed partisan stalling. “All the hot air in the world does not deliver the vaccines, diagnostics and mosquito control that is needed now,” Representative Nita Lowey of New York said.

_____

7. Kelly Ripa got a long standing ovation as she returned to ABC’s “Live With Kelly and Michael.” She skipped a few episodes after her co-host, Michael Strahan, unexpectedly announced that he would move to “Good Morning America,” but she said “apologies have been made” and “our long national nightmare is over.” Above, Ms. Ripa in February.

8. New research and fossil discoveries are building a clearer picture of the intriguing dinosaurs known as titanosaurs, some of which were, as the name suggests, enormous. The remains of a baby showed that it grew from a few pounds at hatching to the size of a large dog in just a couple of months, with adult proportions suggesting rapid independence.

_____

9. A jury faulted the British police for the deaths of 96 soccer fans killed in a crushing stampede at Hillsborough Stadium 27 years ago. Officers opened a gate to try to relieve congestion, leading to chaos that the police long blamed on fans. A statement on behalf of some victims’ families called the debacle “a story of human tragedy” but also one “of deceit and lies.”

_____

10. Today is the 30th anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, generally considered the worst to date. A huge arched shelter that will enclose the remains of the destroyed reactor, above, is nearing completion. When the shelter is put into place, remotely operated equipment will be used to start removing crumbling radioactive fuel.

_____

11. Finally, the makers of “Doctor Strange” have faced accusations of racism for casting Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One, a Tibetan character. A screenwriter said they simply wanted to avoid the character’s origins to avoid offending the Chinese government, which could have blocked them from one of the world’s most lucrative film markets.
