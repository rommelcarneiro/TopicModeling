The cover of Mitski’s highly anticipated fourth album, “Puberty 2,” out this month, shows her standing in a field wearing crudely applied kabuki-like makeup. “It’s kind of saying that I’m of that heritage, but I don’t quite fit,” says the 25-year-old Japanese-American singer. Indeed, much of the album — like the equally brilliant “Bury Me at Makeout Creek” before it — concerns crises of identity, sprung in part from her globe-trotting childhood and in part from being a woman in the still very male-driven indie-music scene. In the video for the fuzz-rock stomper “Your Best American Girl,” she balances a desire to be the “little spoon” with a hilarious send-up of the white bros that dominate her genre. “I’m a woman making music,” she says, “and it turns out I have to be a feminist to do that.”
