Before the advent of hashtags and the surplus of shirts that tout them, the English designer Bella Freud was working with wordplay. Knitted with phrases like “Ginsberg is God,” “Dad” (her father is Lucien Freud) and “Psychoanalysis” (her great-grandfather is Sigmund), her sloganed sweaters have been a hit for more than a decade. Freud’s influences — French New Wave power couples, Rastafarians — are as unexpected as her androgynous hippie look. The 55-year-old, who has a teenage son with the writer James Fox, has made short films with John Malkovich and even penned a column on beauty for The Sunday Telegraph. Now, she’s thinking about starting a line of pajamas and bedding. “I’m always rummaging around markets for vintage striped sheets,” Freud says. “I’m currently in love with the idea of making all the things I want to have in my home.”
