MIAMI — Left fielder Michael Conforto ended an 0-for-20 slump Saturday with a run-scoring single in the eighth inning and scored the tiebreaking run on pinch-hitter Matt Reynolds’s two-out single later in the inning to help the Mets rally past the Miami Marlins and win, 6-4.

Conforto also hit a sacrifice fly in the sixth. He had been a last-minute addition to the lineup after slugger Yoenis Cespedes was scratched because of a sore right hip, the latest in a wave of injuries that has troubled the Mets.

Reynolds put the Mets ahead with the first R.B.I. of his big league career. Alejandro De Aza added a two-out, two-run ground-rule double in the ninth.

Jim Henderson (1-2) got the win in relief, and Jeurys Familia gave up a two-out run-scoring single to Christian Yelich in the ninth before earning his 34th consecutive save, his 18th this year.

David Phelps (4-4) took the loss.
