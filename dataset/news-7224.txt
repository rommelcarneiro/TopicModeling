NAIROBI, Kenya — At least 10 people have died after an apartment building collapsed in heavy rains here in the capital, Kenyan officials said on Saturday.

It is the rainy season in Nairobi, and rain has soaked the city for much of the past week. The building crumbled during a torrential downpour on Friday night, and emergency workers continued to dig through the rubble on Saturday evening, searching for survivors.

Cheers erupted as rescue crews pulled from the rubble dazed people who were covered in the gray powder of cheaply made concrete blocks, a common building material here. One rescued man said more people were trapped inside the building; bystanders said they could hear children’s cries. Several dozen people are still missing.

Red Cross officials said the building’s location in a crowded lower-income area made it difficult to use bulldozers or other heavy equipment to remove debris, leaving the task to security officers and volunteers using light power tools and their hands.

Kenyan officials said the building, which was at least six stories tall and contained several dozen apartments, was built illegally too close to a river.

“The owner of the building, the architect and the engineers who were involved in the construction will have to be arrested and charged,” said Kenya’s interior minister, Joseph Ole Nkaissery, according to the website Capital FM. “They must be brought to book.”

Many buildings in Kenya are built illegally, without proper permits or permission from the local authorities. And during the rainy season, when water sluices through poor neighborhoods, many shoddily constructed buildings have collapsed because of erosion.

Some residents of the building that collapsed on Friday said they felt it shake violently before it went down.

Also on Friday, in another area of Nairobi, four people were killed after a large wall broke apart in the heavy rains.
