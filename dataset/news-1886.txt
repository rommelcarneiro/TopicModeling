After an extended hiatus, HBO’s hit comedy “Curb Your Enthusiasm” is coming back, the premium cable channel announced on Tuesday.

The eighth and most recent season of the show, created by its star, Larry David, was broadcast in 2011. Mr. David, who was also a creator of “Seinfeld,” has said for years that he was unsure if there would be a ninth season.

HBO did not announce when the series’ ninth season would begin filming or when it would air.

“Curb Your Enthusiasm” was broadcast from 2000 to 2011 with a total of 80 episodes. Mr. David’s vaguely autobiographical character became a beloved avatar of misanthropes everywhere. The show was nominated seven times for the Emmy Award for outstanding comedy series , and it won the Golden Globe for best comedy in 2002.

With the show officially returning, it becomes HBO’s longest-running scripted series.

Speculation kicked off in recent days that the show would return when the actor J.B. Smoove, who played Leon on “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” said he had spoken to Mr. David about the show’s possible comeback.

In a statement, Mr. David said, “In the immortal words of Julius Caesar, ‘I left, I did nothing, I returned.’”

In the years since “Curb Your Enthusiasm” last aired, Mr. David wrote and starred in a Broadway play, “Fish in the Dark,” and portrayed Bernie Sanders in the most recent season of “Saturday Night Live,” a performance that earned him wide praise. He also helped write and starred in the 2013 HBO movie “Clear History.”

HBO’s new president of programming, Casey Bloys, said in a statement: “We’re thrilled that Larry has decided to do a new season of Curb and can’t wait to see what he has planned.”
