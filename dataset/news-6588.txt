Good evening. Here’s the latest.

1. “This is not entertainment. This is not a reality show. This is a contest for the presidency of the United States.” With that, President Obama urged journalists at a White House news conference to scrutinize Donald Trump’s record and ideas as he pursues the presidency. One Trump idea unnerved economists: cutting the national debt by giving creditors less than full payment.

2. Hillary Clinton has begun reaching out to Republicans alienated by Mr. Trump, and her campaign expects to assemble a “Republicans for Hillary” group. “Let’s get off the red or the blue team,” she said this week. “Let’s get on the American team.” There was no sign of tensions easing between Mr. Trump and the House speaker, Paul Ryan.

_____

3. London elected its first Muslim mayor, despite rising Islamophobia in the West. He is Sadiq Khan, above, a human rights lawyer of Pakistani descent. Otherwise, the Labour Party lost ground in Scotland and was just steady enough in England and Wales to forestall any immediate threat to the party’s controversial leader, the longtime socialist Jeremy Corbyn.

4. Our Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer Tyler Hicks managed to reach Fort McMurray, the town in western Canada devastated by a wildfire still raging a few miles away. Hundreds of houses had “literally melted,” he says. His photographs capture signs of the rapid evacuation of almost 90,000 people, and the wreckage left by walls of flame and intense heat.

_____

5. Using the name John Doe, the person who leaked the Panama Papers to journalists said he would be willing to give the same documents to law-enforcement agencies in exchange for “immunity from government retribution.” His statement shed light on his motives, enumerating concerns over income inequality, U.S. campaign finance and the “revolving door” between big banks and U.S. government regulators. Above, the law firm whose documents were leaked.

6. These cadets, poised to graduate at West Point, took this photograph last week, setting off speculation that were aligning themselves with the Black Lives Matter movement while in uniform. A West Point alumna who spoke with the seniors said the gesture was more of a pop reference than a political statement. “For them it’s not a sign of allegiance to a movement,” she said, “it’s a sign that means unity and pride and sisterhood.”

_____

7. The media mogul Sumner Redstone reviled his former lover at the opening of the lawsuit she filed challenging his mental competence. He referred to her with expletives and said he wanted her “out of my life.” The proceedings are all but certain to add to the salacious details she revealed about his sexual desires, incontinence and eccentricities. A ruling of incompetence would set off power struggles at Viacom and CBS.

_____

8. A new poll shows deep discontent and fracturing by race and class in Chicago, the nation’s third-largest city. Distrust of the police and fear of crime are prevalent, as is disapproval of Mayor Rahm Emanuel and the city’s overall direction. A resident, Kareen Noble, above with his daughter, said his South Side neighborhood was too violent. “I do allow my kids to go out alone, but not for very long.”

_____

9. Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, convened the first congress of the governing Workers’ Party in 36 years. Analysts concluded that Mr. Kim was bolstering his young leadership with the imprimatur of the full congress. In his speech, he boasted of developing nuclear weapons and missile technology. Intelligence officials say the country’s advances mean the North could hit Japan or South Korea with a nuclear-armed missile.

_____

10. A few suggestions from our entertainment experts: Check out clips of new movies in the video above. For your small screen, Netflix has “Miss Fisher’s Murder Mysteries,” an Australian import with a glamorous detective and great hats. “The Good Wife” comes to an end on Sunday (9 p.m. Eastern, CBS). And our music critics debuted a new feature: a listening/watching playlist. This week: Radiohead’s “Burn the Witch” and seven other songs.

_____

11. Finally, the 142nd Kentucky Derby is Saturday, post time 6:24 p.m. Eastern (NBC). Our race experts’ favorites in the field of 20 3-year-old thoroughbreds: Nyquist (odds: 3-1, running from Post 13) and Mor Spirit (12-1, Post 17).

Good luck!
