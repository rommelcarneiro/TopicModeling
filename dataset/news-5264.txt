Aging does wonders for Chandoka, a prizewinning Cheddar-style cheese made with a mixture of cow’s and goat’s milk by LaClare Farms in Malone, Wis. Its rind takes on a mottled, almost silvery patina as the flavor of the pale cheese becomes more buttery, exhibiting hints of tangy horseradish in the aftertaste. The texture is firm and silkier than is typical for a Cheddar-style cheese. It is aged in the new cheese cave of Standard Market outside Chicago: $25.99 a pound, standardmarket.com/shop/westmont.
