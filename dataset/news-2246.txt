An unidentified buyer paid $59,144,631.66 for the entire 79th floor of 432 Park Avenue, the tallest residential tower in the Western Hemisphere, at 1,396 feet, and home to some of the world’s superwealthy. The transaction was the most expensive closed sale of the week, according to city records.

The apartment is 1,023 feet up the 96-story concrete-and-glass building, and as such, offers spectacular panoramic views of the city and beyond: Central Park to the north, the East River and Atlantic Ocean to the east, the Hudson River and New Jersey to the west, and the Manhattan skyline to the south.

The monthly carrying charges total $32,289.

The identity of the buyer, who was represented by Noel Berk of Engel & Völkers, was shielded by the limited liability company 432 Crotona Park Avenue. Macklowe Properties Sales and Douglas Elliman Development Marketing are handling sales for the building.

The sponsor apartment encompasses 8,055 square feet and includes seven bedrooms, eight full baths and two powder rooms.

And like all 104 residences at 432 Park, on “Billionaires’ Row” between 56th and 57th Streets, the apartment features 12.6-foot ceilings and 10-by-10-foot windows. Each apartment also has a private elevator landing.

The building was designed by Rafael Viñoly Architects and developed by Macklowe Properties and the CIM Group.

Big Ticket includes closed sales from the previous week, ending Wednesday.
