La Caravelle, one of New York’s classic haute-cuisine restaurants, closed in 2004. But for two days in May it will live again, as Rita and André Jammet, below, who owned it for almost half of its 44-year history, recreate the dining experience (though not quite the setting and maybe not the boldface clientele) at Chefs Club by Food & Wine. The event was suggested by Dana Cowin, the former editor in chief of Food & Wine magazine, who is now the creative director of Chefs Club. The three-course menu, prepared by the Caravelle alumni Tadashi Ono, Cyril Renaud and Laurent Richard, along with Chefs Club chefs, will include La Caravelle’s crab salad, quenelles de brochet, chicken in Champagne cream sauce and crème brûlée with raspberries: May 10 and 11; $110, not including beverages, tax or tip; La Caravelle at Chefs Club by Food & Wine, 275 Mulberry Street (Houston Street), 212-941-1100, chefsclub.com, prepaid reservations from chefsclubnyc.tocktix.com.
