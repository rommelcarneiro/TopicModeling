That didn’t take long.

Just nine hours after receiving a lone Tony Award nomination, the producers of the high-camp disco-era musical “Disaster!” said Tuesday that the show would close on Sunday.

“Disaster!,” a spoof of 1970s disaster films, was praised by Charles Isherwood of The New York Times for delivering “a rush of giddy nostalgia.” And Jennifer Simard was widely lauded for her outré turn as a guitar-slinging nun with a soft spot for slot machines — a performance that on Tuesday brought her a nomination for best featured actress in a musical.

But audiences were not interested: The show consistently struggled at the box office, and the producers concluded they could no longer afford to keep it running. The musical had been capitalized at up to $6.5 million, according to a securities offering; that money will now be lost.

“Disaster!,” which combined once-popular and oft-mocked songs with a new book by Seth Rudetsky and Jack Plotnick, had two previous Off Broadway runs; it began performances on Broadway on Feb. 9, opened on March 8 and had been scheduled to close on July 3. Upon its closing, it will have played 32 previews and 72 regular performances.

In recent weeks, it has been playing to half-capacity audiences; last week it grossed $264,032 in eight performances, well below what it costs to keep the musical afloat.

The show’s Nederlander Theater won’t be empty for long. A return engagement of “Motown The Musical” is scheduled to open there on July 12.
