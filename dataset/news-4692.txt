Seven decades ago, a New York mayor looked at his city and realized that it needed more affordable housing, and lots of it. Sound familiar? That mayor was Fiorello H. La Guardia, and his response — the sprawling Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village development in Manhattan — dwarfs anything being planned today. The complex was also, at the insistence of the project’s developer, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, for white families only. “Negroes and whites don’t mix,” said Frederick H. Ecker, then the chairman of MetLife, which received considerable subsidies from the city on the condition that it keep rents low.

By April 1960, when Sam Falk of The New York Times took these photographs, a movement among tenants and civil rights groups had prevailed against the discriminatory policy, and the buildings had been formally open to black residents for a decade (they were also home to my parents, Robert and Dorothy Leland, and their two sons, soon to be three). But on the playgrounds, where security guards kept out people from the surrounding neighborhood, it was still possible to look around and see only white faces.

The children enjoying this spring day were most likely oblivious to these adult machinations. For the 25,000 New Yorkers who called it home, the 80-acre campus was a refuge from the noise and congestion of the city. The red brick complexes, with their family-size apartments, earned the nickname Rabbit Town, for the number of children they produced. These were the shock troops of an urban suburbia, making their way in what had been the Gas House District, north of the East Village, east of everything but the river. It was a place to play, an idyll on a spring afternoon, in a pocket of the city where parents let their kids run around without supervision. Like Stuyvesant Town itself, the images are a vision of calm that hides the unrest lying just below the surface.
