SAN ANTONIO — LaMarcus Aldridge had 38 points Saturday night as the San Antonio Spurs dismantled the Oklahoma City Thunder, 124-92, never trailing in Game 1 of the teams’ second-round series.

Kawhi Leonard added 25 points, 5 rebounds and 5 assists in 22 minutes for San Antonio. The Spurs led by as many as 43 points and sat their starters in the fourth quarter to rest them for Game 2 on Monday night.

Aldridge broke out for his finest performance of the season after Memphis held him to 14.5 points per game in the first round, nearly 7 points below his regular-season average. Aldridge shot 18 for 23, including his first 3-pointer of the season; he even banked in a left-handed scoop shot while falling in the lane.

San Antonio matched a postseason franchise record for points in a quarter with 43 in the opening period. By halftime, Leonard and Aldridge had combined for 45 points, outscoring Oklahoma City by 4.

Serge Ibaka led Oklahoma City with 19 points but was limited to two rebounds. Kevin Durant had 16 points, and Russell Westbrook added 14, but they were harassed into 11-for-34 shooting.

San Antonio shot 82 percent in the opening quarter, including 3 for 4 on 3-pointers, while taking a 23-point lead. The Spurs also blocked six shots, collapsing and surrounding the Thunder with multiple defenders whenever they drove into the lane.

The Spurs’ only scare occurred when Leonard grabbed the back of his left leg after landing awkwardly on a powerful one-handed dunk on the game’s opening possession. Leonard did not say anything when, on the ensuing possession, San Antonio Coach Gregg Popovich asked, “Are you O.K.?” But his dynamic efforts on both ends of the court answered Popovich’s concerns.
