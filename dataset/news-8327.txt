Prince, who died on Thursday at 57, was the human embodiment of synthesis — he wedded the body to the mind, the sacred to the profane, and blurred lines between male and female, black and white, straight and gay. He was a prolific musician and performer, but also prolific with ideas about how to shake up moribund approaches to pop.

Prince’s catalog was huge, and defied neat summation — he was outrageously good at so many things. We touched on several of them on this week’s Popcast. I spoke with the chief pop music critic, Jon Pareles; the music critic Ben Ratliff; and the critic-at-large Wesley Morris about Prince’s relationship to the body, to the music business, and to his fans, but mostly about how what Prince wanted, Prince got.
