MEXICO CITY — An explosion ripped through a petrochemical plant on the southern coast of the Gulf of Mexico on Wednesday, killing three people, injuring dozens and sending flames and a toxin-filled cloud into the air, officials said.

The state oil company Petróleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, said 58 people had been hurt in the midafternoon blast in the industrial port city of Coatzacoalcos. Gov. Javier Duarte of Veracruz State told Radio Formula that three people had lost their lives.

The blast was felt as far as six miles away, Mr. Duarte said, adding that more than 2,000 people were evacuated from the area as a precaution.

By early evening, the fire was reported to be under control, but Pemex still urged people to stay away from the area. Officials canceled Thursday’s classes at area schools.

“The cloud that emanated from the PMV plant in Coatzacoalcos is dissipating rapidly, which means it is losing its toxic effects,” the company said on its Twitter account.

The plant produces vinyl chloride, a hazardous industrial chemical that is used to make PVC pipes and for other purposes.

In early February, a fire killed a worker at the same plant.

Pemex said in a statement that the explosion happened at 3:15 p.m. at the Clorados 3 plant of Petroquímica Mexicana de Vinilo. It said the plant was operated by another company, Mexichem, in partnership with Pemex.

Pemex said that 20 of the injured were treated in a company clinic in Coatzacoalcos and that 38 were taken to nearby hospitals.

There have been a number of accidents in recent years at facilities owned by Pemex or where it operates. Also in February, the company reported that two people were killed and eight injured in a fire on an offshore platform in the Gulf of Mexico.
