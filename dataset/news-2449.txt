Roman Catholic legislators say they have been publicly shamed during Mass and disinvited from parish events as the Philadelphia Archdiocese campaigns against a bill that would give victims of child sexual abuse more time to sue the church. State Representative Nick Miccarelli said he was shocked to learn that the weekly bulletin at his church targeted him. Under the headline “Just So You Are Aware,” the announcement read, “State Representative Miccarelli voted in favor of House Bill 1947, which states that private institutions can be sued as far as 40 years ago for millions of dollars, while public institutions may not be sued for any crimes.” Last weekend, a letter by Archbishop Charles J. Chaput was given to all 219 archdiocese parishes urging parishioners to ask their state senators to vote against the bill. Archbishop Chaput wrote that potential lawsuits would unfairly affect schools and parishes that had nothing to do with the long-ago abuse. He also said the financial ramifications could cripple the ministry. The House overwhelmingly approved the bill in April, and it is being considered by the Senate. (AP)

A prosecutor filed murder charges on Thursday against the driver of a pickup truck that struck a group of bicyclists, killing five of them and seriously injuring four others. The prosecutor, Jeffrey Getting of Kalamzoo County, charged the driver, Charles Pickett Jr., 50, of Battle Creek, with five counts of second-degree murder and four of reckless driving in the crash Tuesday in Cooper Township, north of Kalamazoo. The bicyclists ranged in age from 40 to 74 and were part of a group that called itself the Chain Gang. The cyclists were five miles into a weekly 30-mile ride when they were struck from behind on a road in the western Michigan countryside. The police said that officers had received complaints about a pickup being driven erratically and were searching for it minutes before the crash. (AP)
