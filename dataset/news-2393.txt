The second installment of the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Company’s “Analogy” trilogy will have its New York premiere in October as part of the coming season at New York Live Arts, the organization announced Friday.

“Analogy/Lance: Pretty aka The Escape Artist,” which runs Oct. 25 through Nov. 6, will be a work of dance theater that continues the style of oral history told with movement that the troupe began with “Analogy/Dora: Tramontane,” which had its debut at Peak Performances last year. The two dances will be performed together at the Joyce Theater this fall.

The trilogy is inspired by the W. G. Sebald novel “The Emigrants.” Part 1 told the story of Dora, a 95-year-old who was a nurse during World War II. “Lance,” a preview of which will be shown this weekend at Dancers’ Workshop in Wyoming, tells the story of drug use and the sex trade in the 1980s.

The season opens with “Pandæmonium” (Sept. 28 through Oct. 1), an interdisciplinary work that reflects the aim of New York Live Arts in recent seasons to add diversity to its performance mediums. Created by the dancer and choreographer Nichole Canuso, as well as Geoff Sobelle and Lars Jan from the world of theater, the work combines dance, theater, film and rock music performance.

Other season highlights include the latest installment of the Live Ideas series, which will be curated by the cabaret and visual artist Justin Vivian Bond, who uses the gender-neutral honorific Mx. The theme, “Mx’d Messages,” will use a variety of talks and performances explore the possibilities of a world without binaries.
