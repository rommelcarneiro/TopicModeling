It can be hard to find a functioning seatbelt in an Istanbul taxicab, and when I do, I think twice about putting it on. Why? Because it always seems to outrage the driver — and sometimes leaves me having to defend my very identity as a Turk.

Awkwardness with a cabby was the least of my concerns when a taxi I was in recently started lurching forward at 100 kilometers per hour (62 m.p.h.), more than triple the road’s speed limit.

When the driver heard the click of the buckle, he started uttering, “Op, op, op,” a sound Turks use to get someone’s attention. I met his offended gaze in the rearview mirror.

“Why did you do that?” he demanded. “I can drive!”

Other times, drivers have brushed aside my grasp for safety. “The belt is just an accessory — it doesn’t do anything,” one insisted. Another fairly spat, “This is a car, not a helicopter!”

Turkish cabdrivers have this attitude despite being notorious for speeding, running red lights and recklessly jockeying from lane to lane on the highway without signaling. The younger ones will often watch YouTube videos or play games on their phones while stopped in Istanbul traffic. (TomTom’s annual Traffic Index ranks the city among the world’s most congested.)

A friend was in a taxi recently when the cabby pulled out a thermos and tried to mix a cup of Nescafé as he was driving. Result: fender bender.

Passengers who reach for seatbelts are taken for tourists. For a completely nonscientific study of this phenomenon, I rode in 17 taxis in a single day, and when I buckled up, nine of the drivers asked me where I was from — including one who busted up laughing as I tried to force a broken clasp.

“What’s funny?” I asked in my native Turkish.

“Where are you from?” he said.

“I’m from the Black Sea region,” I replied. “Why did you laugh?”

“Only foreigners do that,” he scoffed. “If you’re really Turkish, then let go, and trust your people.”
