SEATTLE — Jurgen Klinsmann could barely contain his glee late Thursday night after a tense, scrappy quarterfinal encounter with Ecuador in the Copa América.

During the game, Klinsmann had stormed along the sideline in front of his United States team’s bench, waving his arms and exhorting his players.

The United States players responded with an impressive 2-1 victory, which put the United States in the final four of the Copa — something Klinsmann had set as the team’s mission.

But the coach wanted everyone to grasp exactly what that meant and why he was so happy.

“With this tournament being not that popular yet, because it’s difficult for us here to understand what a Copa América is all about, that learning curve is coming through and people understand it more,” Klinsmann said, before adding with emphasis, “Shoot, this is big time.”

The United States last reached this lofty stage — a semifinal of the Copa América — in 1995, when soccer in the United States was only just regaining its footing after several decades in hibernation.

The games of that Copa América had to be watched on pay-per-view television, and few in the United States had a firm grasp of what the Copa really was.

While soccer has grown significantly in the United States since then, many people here still only had a passing understanding of the rich 100-year history of the Copa América, South America’s grand and sometimes rough-around-the-edges continental tournament.

This is the first time the Copa América has been held in the United States — a way to celebrate its 100th anniversary — and it is only the fourth time the United States has been invited to participate.

The most notable result came in 1995, when the United States, on its way to the semifinals, shocked Argentina in the group stage by punching well above its weight. Some called it fluky. The Argentines had already secured passage into the next round, so they did not compete as hard as they could have, and several of their star players did not start that game.

It was still a remarkable victory for the United States, which won convincingly, 3-0.

That victory may have to be repeated if the United States is going to reach its first Copa América final.

The United States will play the winner of Saturday’s quarterfinal between Argentina and Venezuela in Foxborough, Mass. But with players like Lionel Messi, Sergio Agüero and Gonzalo Higuaín, this edition of the Albiceleste is more talented than the one that took the field 21 years ago.

Should it advance, Argentina will not take the game as lightly as its predecessors did.

When Klinsmann was asked about the potential of facing either Argentina or Venezuela, he never entertained the possibility that it would be Venezuela. Argentina, to many, is the best team in the world right now.

“We don’t need to talk about Argentina any bigger than they are,” Klinsmann said.

But he also knows something about beating Argentina. Klinsmann was on the field on a muggy night in 1990 when the former West Germany beat Argentina to win the World Cup in Rome.

That was one of the uglier World Cup finals, a game decided by a lone penalty kick. One of Klinsmann’s contributions was to get fouled by Pedro Monzón, who was sent off for the infraction, leaving Argentina with 10 men and no hope.

But the United States is now the one with a limited list of eligible players. Jermaine Jones, a key midfielder who set up the first goal by Clint Dempsey on Thursday, was shown a red card during a fracas in the second half.

He cannot play in the next game, and neither can Alejandro Bedoya or Bobby Wood. Both carried yellow cards into Thursday’s game and received cards again, so they are ineligible.

Bedoya, who was carded in the 73rd minute, lamented that he would not be able to play next week, but he said the players had discussed the matter before the game.

“We knew going into this game that some of us were on yellow cards,” he said, “but we all spoke before that — who cares? The most important thing was to make the semis, and we did.”

After Jones was sent off, Michael Bradley, the United States captain, called the players together to reorganize and refocus.

Bradley said he had no issues with his teammates’ accumulating the yellow cards under those circumstances, particularly Wood, who wore scratch marks on his cheek as evidence of the game’s passion.

“Bobby spilled his guts for the team tonight,” Bradley said.

But Dempsey was the man of the match. He opened the scoring on a header off a pretty feed from Jones.

Gyasi Zardes scored for the United States in the 65th minute on a ball sent across the goal mouth by Dempsey. But then Ecuador began to push forward with more consistent pressure, and Michael Arroyo scored in the 74th minute.

The last quarter of an hour was dicey for the United States, but Klinsmann’s men held on to advance and gathered more confidence with another step in a major tournament.

“They are just getting more and more of those messages,” Klinsmann said. “They understand what the next level up there is about. The Copa América is, after World Cup and together with the Euros, the next level to play at. What they did was absolutely outstanding.”
