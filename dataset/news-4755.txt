I noticed it because I have bought that same exact meal many times. This has led me to wonder if it’s mine but I forgot about it, which would be uncharacteristic of me. Still, do I have a reasonable claim to the biryani?

You could have just left a note that says: “Hello. My brain is breaking as I hurtle toward death. I don’t know who or what I am anymore. Is this my biryani or what?” But you haven’t. Because you know, as I do, that this is a mystery biryani, hovering in a quantum state between stolen property and your own. And so I order you to seize it, and all the ambiguity it embodies. Eat it in plain sight in the break room. Savor its power to transform you. Are you a thief? Or just a man aging into senility, eating the ghost food of his younger, forgotten self? The mystery biryani will never say. (If someone yells at you, though, mystery solved: You’re a thief.)
