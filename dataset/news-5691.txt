The inaugural France Rocks Summerfest, billed as the largest French music festival in the United States, will bring more than 30 performers to roughly 25 locations in New York from June 3 through July 23.

Among the musicians are a mixture of emerging and established artists, like the young jazz vocalist Cyrille Aimée, and Lisa Simone, the daughter of Nina Simone. Ms. Aimée will perform at Joe’s Pub on July 5; Ms. Simone, at Herbert Von King Park in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, on June 28, in a program that includes a screening of the Oscar-nominated documentary “What Happened, Miss Simone?”

Other venues include Le Poisson Rouge and National Sawdust, as well as the Standard Hotel in the East Village, where the emerging male duo Her performs on June 14. The festival will also include existing annual events like the daylong Fête de la Musique, based on the French holiday, in Central Park on June 21.

As with many other Francophile festivals — like the French Institute Alliance Française’s Tilt and Crossing the Line — France Rocks Summerfest is presented in part by the Cultural Services of the French Embassy, among other French sponsors.
