It’s a perfect show for the age of Brexit: A woman is found dead at the midpoint of the Channel Tunnel, half her body in France and the other half in Britain, and detectives from both countries are called to investigate. But what begins as one murder becomes two, with the bodies bisected at the waist and positioned to form a single corpse, in “The Tunnel,” debuting Sunday, June 19, on PBS. “Look, she comes apart like the eurozone!” the butcher — nicknamed the Truth Terrorist because he claims to kill to shed light on societal woes — later taunts.

Adapted from “The Bridge,” the Scandinavian noir set on the Oresund Bridge linking Sweden and Denmark, and centered on the socially inept detective Saga Noren, “The Tunnel” hews closely to the original. Clémence Poésy portrays the French detective Elise Wasserman, standing in for Noren, as a brilliantly odd bird. Stephen Dillane is her British counterpart, Karl Roebuck, who half-jokingly wonders if her bad manners are because she’s Gallic. Above ground, the setting volleys between the white cliffs of Dover and the beach of Calais. You might have seen the story before (an adaptation on FX placed the body on the United States-Mexico border), but not played out quite like this.
