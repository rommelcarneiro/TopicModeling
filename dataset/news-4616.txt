NEW YORK

A map in some editions last Sunday with an article about the opening of a walkway to Randalls Island from the Bronx omitted another pedestrian approach. The 103rd Street Walkway allows people to reach the southeastern corner of the island from Manhattan. An updated map can be found at nytimes.com/nyregion.

METROPOLITAN

An art review in some editions on May 8 about the LongHouse Reserve sculpture garden and landscape art center misstated the surname of an artist whose work “The Invisible” is on display there. He is Enrique Martinez Celaya, not Ceyala.

•

An outdoors listing in the Connecticut Calendar in some editions on May 1 about bird club field trips in Milford misstated the telephone numbers for the New Haven Bird Club’s tour guides. They are 203-888-5757 for the tour in the River Wildlife Sanctuary and 203-526-7667 for the tour on the Housatonic River. The error was repeated in a listing on May 8.

•

Because of an editing error, a theater review in some editions last Sunday about “White Guy on the Bus” misstated part of the name of the theater in Trenton where the play is being performed through today. It is the Mill Hill Playhouse, not the Mill House Playhouse.

SPORTS

The On Golf column on May 5, about a decision by some top golfers not to participate in the Rio de Janeiro Olympics, referred incorrectly to a precaution Rory McIlroy was taking before going to the Olympics. While McIlroy said he was willing to get a vaccination for the Zika virus, there is not currently such a vaccine.

THE MAGAZINE

An article on Page 29 this weekend about Donald J. Trump’s improbable journey to the Republican nomination for president misstates the sequence of events by which Paul Manafort, a senior adviser, joined Trump’s presidential campaign. Manafort was referred to Trump by more than one person close to the campaign, not just by the former Trump adviser Roger Stone, and Manafort’s March 24 meeting with Trump occurred before, not after, Trump read a Wall Street Journal article describing Ted Cruz’s delegate strategy.

•

An article on May 8 about prostitution misstated the legal status of prostitution in the Netherlands. It is legal throughout the country — not just in Amsterdam — though subject to local regulations. The article also misidentified the academic field of Elizabeth Bernstein, a Barnard professor who studies sex work. She is a sociologist, not an anthropologist. And the article described Bulgaria incorrectly. It is a Balkan State, not a Baltic State.

T: TRAVEL

An entry in the “This and That” feature on Page 32 this weekend about a new collaboration between the jeweler Brooke Garber Neidich and the fashion designer Duro Oluwo erroneously includes one person among those who are fans of the Sidney Garber jewelry line, which Garber Neidich designs. While Hillary Clinton might be a fan, as the article noted, that could not be confirmed. (She is, however, friends with Garber Neidich.) The article also refers incompletely to the fabrics Oluwo uses in his designs. They come from a variety of sources, not just African-printed fabrics.

•

An article on Page 110 this weekend about the British designer Chloe Lonsdale’s denim brand M.i.h. and her house in Sussex erroneously includes one person among those involved in Lonsdale’s London pop-up shop. While the boutique owner Alex Eagle was involved at one point, that is no longer the case. In addition, an accompanying picture caption misidentifies a collection to which a dress of Lonsdale’s design belongs. It is part of M.i.h. Jeans’s pre-fall 2016 collection, not the Cult Denim Project collection.

•

A picture caption on Page 144 this weekend with an article about the cultural resilience of the people of Beirut in the face of continuing political strife misstates the time of day the photograph was taken. It was sunset, not sunrise.

SUNDAY REVIEW

An Opinion article last Sunday about the intelligence of fishes misidentified the cause of the overfishing of bluefin tuna. Bluefin tuna are harvested for sushi; they are not used by the canning industry.

•

A map accompanying an Opinion article last Sunday about the drawing of borders in the Middle East mislabeled the country on the far right portion of the map. It is Iran, not Iraq.

ARTS & LEISURE

An article last Sunday about a group of gospel singers misstated the surname of the editor in chief of Root, a magazine aimed at young gospel fans. He is Hasan James, not Jones.

•

A Q. and A. with Eva Green on May 8 misidentified the profession of a character on the show “Penny Dreadful.” Dr. Seward, played by Patti LuPone, is an alienist, not a mentalist.

SUNDAY STYLES

An article last Sunday about the model Gisele Bündchen misidentified the game after which Ms. Bündchen, whose husband is the New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, was videotaped reacting emotionally to the team’s loss. It was Super Bowl XLVI, when the Patriots lost to the New York Giants. It was not Super Bowl XLIX, when they beat the Seattle Seahawks.

•

A picture caption last Sunday with a brief article about the Glass House, Philip Johnson’s estate in New Canaan, Conn., omitted the credit. The photograph, of a dancer rehearsing at the house, was taken by Evan Whale.

VOWS

A report on May 8, about the marriage of Irim Salik and Mahmud Riffat, misspelled part of the name of the group through which the couple’s officiant received her ordination. It is the First Nation Church, not the First Nation’s Church.

REAL ESTATE

The Hunt column on May 8 misstated the sales price of a co-op on Montague Street in Brooklyn Heights. It was $700,000, not $649,000.

BOOK REVIEW

A review last Sunday about the memoir “Sex With Shakespeare” referred incorrectly to the sexual orientation of the author, Jillian Keenan. While the two principal sexual relationships examined in the book were with men, she says she is not “mostly heterosexual.”

•

The Open Book feature on May 8 misstated the medium of a 1994 adaptation of Richard Russo’s novel “Nobody’s Fool,” in which Paul Newman played the protagonist. It was a studio film for general release, not an HBO production. (It was another Russo novel, “Empire Falls,” that was adapted for a 2005 HBO mini-series, in which Newman also had a role.)

TRAVEL

An article on May 15 about Berlin misspelled the name of a cookie sold at a Berlin bakery. It is Ampelmännchen, not Ampfelmännchen. And a picture caption described Krumme Lanke incorrectly. It is one of several lakes in the Grunewald, not one of two lakes.

•

An article on May 8 about astrotourism on the Canary Islands overstated Columbus’s connection to the islands. While he stopped there in 1492, he did not discover the islands. Other European navigators visited the islands before him.

•

An article on May 1, about Denver’s Union Station, incorrectly described the airport train schedule at Denver’s Union Station. The train to the airport from Union Station runs every 15 minutes from 4:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. daily. It does not run every 15 minutes between 3 a.m. and 1 a.m. the following day.
