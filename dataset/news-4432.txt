There’s a tune that’s familiar to anyone who has ever had to sit through an American graduation ceremony.

But the song and its history are thoroughly British.

Edward Elgar wrote the music of the “Pomp and Circumstance” March No. 1 in 1901 in London.

The title is from Act III of “Othello”: “Farewell the neighing steed, and the shrill trump,/ The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,/ The royal banner, and all quality,/ Pride, pomp and circumstance of glorious war!”

Lyrics — which do not contain “Go forth, new graduates!” or any variation of that — were added for the 1902 coronation of King Edward VII, and the piece became known as “Land of Hope and Glory.”

So how did a patriotic British song become an anthem for American students?

In 1905, Elgar came to Yale to receive an honorary doctorate of music.

In his honor, the “Pomp and Circumstance” March No. 1 was played as the graduates and guests left the hall, and the audience loved it.

Other colleges noticed and followed Yale’s lead. More than a century later, no graduation seems complete without it.
