Artists Space, the venerable nonprofit gallery that was founded in SoHo in 1972 and has spent most of its peripatetic existence in that neighborhood, will close its main space there on Greene Street in June because its landlord is planning to build a penthouse atop the building.

The gallery, which was founded to focus on emerging artists and has been home to several landmark exhibitions during its history, has operated out of a large loft space at 38 Greene Street since 1993 and is one of the few reminders left of SoHo’s storied art past. Stefan Kalmar, the executive director and curator of Artists Space, said that the institution had 29 months remaining on its lease but decided to negotiate a buyout in light of the building owner’s planned penthouse expansion. That project would cause construction headaches and would most likely lead to a significant increase in the rent for its exhibition space.

He added that Artists Space had already begun hunting for a new location, to lease long-term or to buy, that would be large enough to accommodate its exhibition programs and also the activities of its Artists Space Books & Talks program, which it has run out of a space at 55 Walker Street in TriBeCa since 2012.

Mr. Kalmar said that it was too early to say where the institution might alight, but that it was important for it to move “into a neighborhood where artists currently live and work, which has not been the case for a long time in SoHo.”
