As the summer action-blockbuster season begins, the Museum of the Moving Image serves up a reminder of how to navigate the apocalypse with its “Mad Max Weekend,” screening all four helpings of George Miller’s dystopian future in the Australian outback.

The original “Mad Max” (1979) introduced Max Rockatansky (a then-unknown Mel Gibson), a highway patrolman bent on revenge after marauding bikers attack his family, and refined the car chase as a cinematic genre on an indie budget. “The Road Warrior” (1981) surpassed the original with its character development and vehicular stunts. “Beyond Thunderdome” (1985) was a cage-fight spectacle, with Tina Turner as Aunty Entity, the matriarch of Bartertown. And, of course, “Fury Road” (2015), nominated for 10 Oscars, winning six, rebooted the series, with a new Max — Tom Hardy — playing backup to the force of nature that is Charlize Theron’s Imperator Furiosa.
