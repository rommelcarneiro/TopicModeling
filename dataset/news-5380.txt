LONDON — Barclays said on Monday that it had agreed to sell its precious metals storage business in Britain to ICBC Standard Bank for an undisclosed amount.

The British bank, which is in the midst of a reshaping under its new chief executive, James E. Staley, is seeking to improve its prospects by accelerating the sale of businesses it does not consider core operations. The bank has focused its strategy around two divisions: the British consumer bank, and the corporate and investment bank.

Barclays announced its intention to exit from precious metals in January and moved the business into its noncore operations.

“This sale represents further progress with our noncore rundown as we work to simplify Barclays’ operations and achieve our cost and capital reduction commitments,” John Mahon, a co-leader of the division of the bank known as Barclays Non-Core, said in a news release.

The precious metals vault, which has been in operation since 2012, has the capacity to hold 2,000 tons of gold.
