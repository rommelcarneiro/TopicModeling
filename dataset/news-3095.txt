Short of couch surfing in an artist’s home, the new Green Rooms hotel in London may be the city’s most affordable stay amid a creative community. The nonprofit concept is meant to attract artists, musicians and actors visiting and working in London. The hotel also has partnerships with local cultural institutions including Somerset House and the Royal Court theater to house their visiting artists. But the developers say some rooms, which include 22 doubles, two studio apartments and two dormitory rooms, one that sleeps 12 and the other 16, will always be available to the public. Lodged in a 1935-vintage power company building, Green Rooms is in North London across from the Wood Green Underground station, about a 20-minute ride from the West End. Rates start at £18 (about $26) a night.

Travelers to Yosemite National Park in California have new accommodations to consider booking with the June 15 opening of Rush Creek Lodge, which claims to be the first resort to open in the Yosemite region in more than 25 years. Situated a half-mile outside the park on 20 wooded acres, the property has 143 rooms ranging from 400 to 625 square feet; all have sitting areas and spacious decks, most with sunset views. Other amenities include a large salt water pool; two hot tubs, one for families and another for adults; a children’s zip line; a farm-to-table restaurant with a wood-fired oven; and a main lodge with a fireplace, game room and an indoor tree house. In addition to its proximity to the park, the resort has a team of recreation specialists who can arrange for activities within Yosemite like guided and self-guided hikes, bike rides, excursions to swimming holes and fly-fishing trips to the Tuolumne Meadows area. Prices from $215 a night for two people.
