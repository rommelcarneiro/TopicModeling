NAIROBI, Kenya — As emergency workers retrieved four bodies from a building that collapsed a week ago, raising the death toll to 41, hundreds of Nairobi residents were evicted Friday from nearby buildings that are being torn down to prevent other disasters.

The demolitions began even as rescuers continued digging through debris from the collapsed seven-story building, which fell during a period of heavy rain. Four survivors were rescued Thursday but one later died. A pregnant woman among the four people who were rescued also lost her baby.

At least 70 people remain missing. As rescue work continued in the rain on Friday, hopes dimmed of finding more survivors.

After eight buildings collapsed in the country last year, killing 15 people, an audit of Kenya’s buildings found that 58 percent in Nairobi were unfit for habitation. Following this building collapse, authorities are taking action by tearing down condemned buildings.

But residents evicted from buildings in the Huruma neighborhood complained they were not given enough time to find alternative housing.

“Since our neighbors’ building collapsed we were given less than a week’s notice to leave which is not enough,” Anna Kaloki said.

“Sometimes the government does things without considering the people, and we are not the ones who have done wrong we are just tenants,” she said. “The people who constructed these substandard buildings should be forced to get us alternative accommodation and we should not pay for it.”
