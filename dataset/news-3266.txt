A special prosecutor will handle the case of a white Chicago police officer who shot a black teenager, a judge said Thursday, while civil rights lawyers pressed for a broader investigation into whether other officers attempted a cover-up. A dashboard camera video of the October 2014 killing of Laquan McDonald, 17, showed Officer Jason Van Dyke, firing 16 shots into Mr. McDonald’s body even after he crumpled to the ground. Judge Vincent Gaughan said that he would search for an outside prosecutor after the Cook County state’s attorney, Anita Alvarez, asked last month to step aside. She lost a March primary election under criticism of her handling of the case. (AP)

A prosecutor said on Thursday that he would dismiss charges against elementary school students who were taken to a juvenile facility — some in handcuffs — in view of parents. The police in Murfreesboro arrested four children at Hobgood Elementary School in April and took them away, saying they took part in off-campus bullying. Six other children were named in juvenile court petitions. Parents and community leaders protested, and the Rutherford County prosecutor, Jennings Jones, said Thursday that he would drop the charges. He would not say why. (AP)
