Eurovision has finally made its way onto American television. The popular European song contest, now in its 61st season, will air the season’s Grand Final live on Logo on May 14.

More than 200 million viewers tuned into the show last season, making it the most watched live entertainment program in Europe, according to Eurovision. Previously, American fans were only able to watch the competition’s final by live-streaming it through the Eurovision site. The show recently revamped its voting system and has laid out plans to stage a similar contest in Asia. It also recently received criticism after it banned its audience from waving Palestinian flags.

The final will be held in Stockholm at 3 p.m. Eastern Standard Time and will be available in the United States on logotv.com and on Logo’s mobile app.
