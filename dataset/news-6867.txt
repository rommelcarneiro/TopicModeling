PARIS — Société Générale, one of France’s largest banks, reported on Wednesday a rise in first-quarter profit, as a one-time revaluation of its own debt and a shift in the way it prepares for potential bad loans helped it offset a weak market for investment banking.

Société Générale said net income rose almost 7 percent to 924 million euros, or about $1.1 billion, in the three months through March from the same period a year earlier.

Without one-time items, which included the debt revaluation, profit would have slipped less than 1 percent to €829 million. As it was, the bottom line was better than the market had been expecting. Analysts surveyed by Reuters and Bloomberg had expected earnings to decline as much as €100 million.

The bank said revenue fell 3.3 percent to €6.2 billion.

Société Générale’s French retail banking unit contributed about 18 percent more to the bank’s profit than a year earlier, while the international retail banking and financial services unit posted an increase of 83 percent. Results in both divisions improved in part because the bank set aside less money against possible loan losses.

Those gains helped offset a 12 percent decline in profit in the unit that includes investment banking, which was affected by the “turbulence in the equity markets” in the first quarter. The bank promised more savings at the investment banking unit, saying that it was “pursuing its efforts to control costs and risks” there.

On Tuesday, Société Générale’s crosstown rival, BNP Paribas, also surprised the market with stronger-than-expected profit, thanks to lower loan-loss reserves, even as revenue declined.

Business conditions in the first quarter of 2016 were “more challenging” than was the case a year earlier, Frédéric Oudéa, the chief executive of Société Générale, said in the earnings statement. Despite that, the bank “generated sound results,” showing “the benefits of its diversified and highly integrated business model.”

The bank said its core Tier 1 equity ratio, a measure of its ability to withstand financial shocks, rose 25 basis points in the period, to 11.1 percent.
