A state court judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked state authorities from licensing as a child care facility a federal immigration detention center holding migrant children and their mothers. The Texas Department of Family and Protective Services was preparing to issue a child care license to the center, located in Dilley, where families seeking asylum, including very young children, are detained. Ruling on an emergency request by Grassroots Leadership, a prison advocacy group, Judge Karin Crump of Travis County found it was “probable” that new regulations adopted by the department to support the license were inconsistent with state law. On Friday, Texas issued a child care license to a similar detention center nearby in Karnes City. JULIA PRESTON

The name of a founder of the University of Tulsa law school, John Rogers, will be removed from campus because of his ties to the Ku Klux Klan. Trustees voted Wednesday to remove the name from the law school building. Mr. Rogers was a lawyer and philanthropist who helped found the law school in 1943, served as its unpaid dean for years and was a trustee for decades. He also helped incorporate the K.K.K.-affiliated Tulsa Benevolent Association. It was founded months after the 1921 Tulsa race riot that left about 300 black residents dead and a thriving section of downtown — known as Black Wall Street — decimated. (AP)
