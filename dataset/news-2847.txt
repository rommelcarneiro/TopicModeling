Only four years after its last revival, “The Glass Menagerie” will return to Broadway, starring two-time Academy Award winner Sally Field as Amanda Wingfield.

Also starring with Ms. Field in Tennessee Williams’s 1944 family drama will be the actor-director Joe Mantello, as Tom Wingfield, and Finn Wittrock, as the Gentleman Caller. Sam Gold will direct the production, which he developed (with a different cast) in 2015 at Toneelgroep Amsterdam.

Madison Ferris, a newcomer, will be Laura, the disabled Wingfield daughter, protected by her mother, whose romantic illusions are buoyed and then crushed. Ms. Ferris will be the rare Broadway actor who performs in a wheelchair.

In a statement on the Toneelgroep website, Mr. Gold said that as a father, the character of Amanda resonates with him in new ways. “It surprises me that I recognize myself in her now, in her tormented love for her children,’’ he said.

The last Broadway revival of “Glass Menagerie” began at the American Repertory Theater in 2013, and earned Tony nominations for the cast members Cherry Jones, Brian J. Smith and Celia Keenan-Bolger.

Mr. Gold’s production will begin performances at the Golden Theater on Feb. 14 with an official opening night set for March 23. Scott Rudin is the lead producer.
