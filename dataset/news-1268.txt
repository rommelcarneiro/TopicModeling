Here are the week’s top stories, and a look ahead.

1. The mass shooting in Orlando, Fla., reverberated through some of the most divisive issues roiling the U.S.: gay rights, gun control, immigration, the Islamic State and homegrown terrorism, fear of Islam. The gunman, Omar Mateen, a first-generation American, had a history of abusive, aggressive behavior, but no confirmed ties to extremist groups. President Obama tried to console families of the 49 victims as the long chain of funerals began.

2. Finger-pointing was big. Donald Trump swept aside criticism from his own party to broaden his accusations against Muslims. He suggested U.S. Muslims were hiding information about planned attacks, called for surveillance of mosques and promised, if elected, to halt immigration from “areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism.” President Obama and Hillary Clinton reacted with scathing denunciations. “Not one of Donald Trump’s reckless ideas would have saved a single life in Orlando,” Mrs. Clinton said.

3. Congressional discussions of gun control quickly reached a stalemate, and four measures up for vote in the Senate on Monday appear doomed. Susan Collins of Maine, the Senate’s most moderate Republican, is working on a long-shot fifth measure. In the courts, a key hearing comes Monday in a suit filed by families of children killed in 2012 at Sandy Hook Elementary School. The suit, seeking to hold the maker of the assault rifle that the gunman used responsible for selling a weapon of war to civilians, has already survived many challenges. Above, the rifle, a Bushmaster AR-15.

4. Britain was stunned by the killing of Jo Cox, 41, a rising political star and member of Parliament, a week before the nation’s voters were to decide on whether Britain should leave the European Union. Her position against a “Brexit” had drawn threats in the increasingly bitter, sometimes xenophobic debate. The 52-year-old suspect portrayed in the sketch above, who appeared to have ties with neo-Nazi and far-right groups, told a court, “My name is death to traitors, freedom for Britain.”

5. New champions will be crowned in golf and basketball by the end of the day. The defending U.S. Open champion, Jordan Spieth, struggled to regain lost ground in a tournament thrown out of order by early rain delays. Another comeback win by the Cleveland Cavaliers over the Golden State Warriors forced the N.B.A. finals into Game 7 (8 p.m. Eastern, ABC). In soccer, the U.S. team made it to the semifinals of the Copa América. And Olympic officials backed a doping-related ban on Russian track and field athletes competing in the Rio Games.

6. One of our best-read stories this week offers a kind of sequel to the beloved 1965 film “The Sound of Music”: the romance and marriage of the great-grandson of Maria and Georg von Trapp. Nathaniel Peters and his bride met studying theology and for their first date read P.G. Wodehouse in Boston’s Public Garden. “I’ve felt like I’m wading into a pool of joy and I don’t know the depth of the joy yet,” the groom said.

7. Unemployment is low, wages are rising and the U.S. economy is growing, but the Federal Reserve wasn’t persuaded. The central bank declined to increase interest rates, reflecting the impact of global deflationary forces. Meanwhile, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved a new stock exchange, the nation’s 13th. Created by critics of high-frequency trading portrayed in the book “Flash Boys,” the IEX exchange will operate with a “speed bump” of 350 microseconds.

8. A forgetful fish jazzed up the lackluster summer box office. “Finding Dory,” the sequel to Pixar’s acclaimed “Finding Nemo” (2003), is on track to surpass $130 million for its opening weekend in North America. That would be a high for an animated film and would land “Dory” in the top 20 releases ever. Our critic praised the film as warm and funny and said its ingenious use of creatures with various disabilities made it a “celebration of cognitive and physical differences.”

9. Microsoft put itself in the headlines twice. The tech giant paid $26.2 billion to buy LinkedIn, one of the biggest deals of the year. The company, which is remaking the corporate world with cloud computing, could be betting on a future with less lifetime employment and more freelance and consulting work. And Microsoft also announced plans for software that tracks marijuana plants from seed to sale, becoming the first major U.S. company to serve the burgeoning marijuana industry.

10. Good news for coffee drinkers: A panel of experts not only reversed a previous finding that coffee is “possibly carcinogenic,” but now says it could protect against two types of cancer. The group, convened by the World Health Organization, also said there’s a lack of evidence that it could cause other types of cancer. So, drink on — and if you want more flavor in your cup, freeze the beans, which makes the grind smaller and more uniform.

_____

11. Looking ahead: The Supreme Court goes into summer recess at the end of June. So look for the justices to hand down major decisions this week or next on affirmative action in Texas, immigration, abortion and the corruption charges against Bob McDonnell, the former governor of Virginia. Since the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February, the court — now evenly divided — has been issuing decisions that are more modest and ephemeral than before.

_____

12. Finally: “Solstice, we call it, the summer solstice, when the earth begins to swing back on its trunnions and the longest day of the year is at hand and daylight begins its creeping abbreviation once more.” That’s from a short column, with no byline, from our newspaper of June 20, 1954. This year, the solstice, which marks the first day of summer, begins Monday at 6:34 p.m. Eastern.

Have a great summer!
