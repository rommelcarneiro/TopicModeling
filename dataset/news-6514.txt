Amtrak resumed its service between New York City and New Haven on Friday night after an interruption of more than two hours because of a power failure, a company spokeswoman said.

The power went out around 5:30 p.m. and was restored around 8 p.m., the spokeswoman, Kimberly Woods, said.

It was not clear how many trains had been affected by the power failure. Ms. Woods said passengers would continue to experience delays related to congestion caused by the failure.

Some passengers wrote of their frustrations on Twitter:

A passenger on an Acela train bound for Boston from Pennsylvania Station, Nadine Hays of Wayland, Mass., said her train had been stuck in the Bronx for more than two hours without electricity.

In a telephone interview around 7:30 p.m., she said that the train started to move after a diesel train had arrived to push it. Despite the delay, Ms. Hays professed her appreciation for train travel.

“Living with the airlines — I travel a lot — a two-and-a-half-hour delay is not the end of the world,” she said.
