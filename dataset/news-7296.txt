The percussionist and singer Román Díaz opens his spirited recent album, “L’ó dá fún Bàtá” (Motéma), with a vocal invocation to Eleguá, the Yoruban lord of the crossroads. For Mr. Díaz, it’s an elegant way of flying his colors as one of the leading stewards of the Afro-Cuban tradition in New York. On some level, it also sets a tone for a concert and film series like the Source Project, running during the first week of May at Symphony Space.

The series proposes a celebration of African influence in Western culture, starting with a focus on Cuba. Mr. Díaz’s Rumba Ensemble opens the festivities at 11 a.m. on Sunday, May 1, with a street party on Broadway between 93rd and 94th Streets. Subsequent performances will feature the singer Xiomara Laugart (Monday); the tenor saxophonist and percussionist Yosvany Terry (Thursday); and the percussionist Pedrito Martínez, drawing from his new album, “Habana Dreams,” with a featured appearance by the great sonero Issac Delgado (May 8).
