While Chris Wilson, 59, was moving to Bushwick from Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, with his husband, Karl Brown, 57, and their two children a year ago, he was amazed that a nearby resident offered to move his car to accommodate the moving truck.

“This is a place where street parking is prime,” said Mr. Wilson, who bought a two-bedroom two-bathroom condominium with Mr. Brown at 330 Bleecker Street for $750,000. “And somebody said, ‘Would you like me to move my car so we could fit the truck in there?’ And that says a lot about a community.”

Mr. Wilson, a registered nurse who spent part of the 1980s and 1990s living in the East Village, said Bushwick “has that same flavor to it, and we’re really enjoying it.”

Bushwick, with about 113,000 residents according to United States Census data, has seen quite a bit of change in recent years. The number of Hispanic residents grew to 73,608, more than 65 percent of the population, in 2010, an increase of 4.9 percent from 2000, with the number of Puerto Ricans declining and Mexicans and Dominicans growing. The number of white non-Hispanics more than tripled from 2000 to 2010, to 9,560, while the number of black non-Hispanics fell by almost 9 percent, to 22,686.

The number of residents ages 20 to 34 grew by around 28 percent, to 34,227, from 2000 to 2010.

Paris Smeraldo, 47, who opened perhaps the first trendy restaurant in Bushwick, Northeast Kingdom, in 2005, with his wife, Meg Lipke, said they recognized that another couple of stops on the L train weren’t going to keep people priced out of Manhattan from checking out Bushwick.

“We’d been living in Williamsburg, and we saw what happened there — that in a few years, it just blew up — and we knew it was inevitable here,” Mr. Smeraldo said.

Now, the couple have closed Northeast Kingdom for various reasons, and moved upstate to the Hudson, N.Y., area; Ms. Lipke, an artist, keeps a studio in Bushwick. Mr. Smeraldo said Northeast Kingdom was thriving, but he wanted it to go out at the top of its game.

“Bushwick, in the past two or three years, has really become a completely different neighborhood,” he said. “There’s so much more in the neighborhood — easily, 30 or 40 businesses have opened in the past three years.” Kevin Adey, a former executive chef of Northeast Kingdom, and his wife, Debbie Adey, own one of them, a restaurant called Faro they opened last year in an old warehouse on Jefferson Street.

Bushwick, a working-class neighborhood that suffered looting and arson after the blackout of 1977, began gentrifying around the early 2000s when artists started looking for cheap, large industrial spaces there to use as studios. Now the area has become associated with colorful street art.

The Bushwick Collective is an outdoor gallery founded by Joseph Ficalora, a local resident who gets owners to donate space on buildings for street art; one main area is Troutman Street between Cypress and Irving Avenues.

Many artists in Bushwick are having problems these days with rising rents and finding studio spaces, Mr. Ficalora said. He said the Bushwick Collective and other artists’ groups are working with Brooklyn Community Board 4, which represents the area, to keep bars, clubs and restaurants from becoming as large a presence as they have in Williamsburg. “We want an eclectic community,” he said.

Bushwick is a sprawling neighborhood in northern Brooklyn that has Broadway, with its elevated train, as its southwestern boundary with Bedford-Stuyvesant. That Broadway boundary stretches from Flushing Avenue in the north down to Stewart Street, where it runs into the beautiful Evergreens Cemetery, then borders the cemetery to about Irving Avenue. The northeastern boundary of the neighborhood, which separates it from Ridgewood, Queens, meanders up the avenues, including Irving, Wyckoff, St. Nicholas and Cypress Avenues.

The avenues have a lot of art galleries, boutiques, restaurants and bars, largely because of the proximity of the L train. The area north of Myrtle Avenue has much more industry and a lot of heavy truck traffic.

South Bushwick has two- and three-family houses, mostly clapboard, although there are some brick and limestone and even the odd brownstone. This part of Bushwick is more residential, said Justine Lee-Mills, a local resident and an agent at the Corcoran Group.

Bushwick may be one of the few neighborhoods in Brooklyn where you can buy a two-family rowhouse for less than $1.5 million, and sometimes substantially less, depending on the home’s condition, Ms. Lee-Mills said.

Condo prices are harder to pin down. They can go as low as $400,000 for a studio or a small one-bedroom, she said. A two-bedroom condo in a walk-up building might go for about $700,000, or about $750 per square foot. Three-bedroom condos can be hard to find, she added, and co-ops are few.

Prices over all rose roughly 15 to 20 percent from 2013 to 2015, said Jerry Minsky, an agent with Douglas Elliman Real Estate who specializes in Brooklyn.

As for rentals, Ms. Lee-Mills said, many are in rowhouses, with a one-bedroom about $1,850 to $2,300 and a two-bedroom around $2,300 to $2,800.

NurtureArt is a nonprofit gallery at 56 Bogart Street, where many emerging artists are exhibited.

Tina’s Place on Flushing Avenue is a diner that has been in the same family since the 1930s. Its odd hours, from 3:30 a.m. to 4 p.m., were initially intended to cater to factory workers, although the diner is now a hot spot for artists. Lucy’s Vietnamese Kitchen, which opened last year on Irving Avenue, has a strong following. For food and entertainment under one roof, a 50-seat movie theater, bar and restaurant called Syndicated on Bogart Street opened in January.

The Kings County Brewers Collective plans to open on Troutman Street by midsummer.

The nearly seven-acre Maria Hernandez Park was named after a woman who was instrumental in fighting drug dealers, with her husband, Carlos, until she was fatally shot in 1989. The park includes basketball and handball courts and playgrounds.

There are about two dozen public schools in Bushwick. One, Public School 116 Elizabeth L. Farrell, serves about 510 students in kindergarten through fifth grade. According to the city’s 2014-2015 School Quality Snapshot, 22 percent of students met state standards in English, compared with 30 percent citywide; 38 percent met standards in math, compared with 39 percent.

Another, P.S. 86 the Irvington, serves about 410 students in kindergarten through fifth grade. According to the city’s 2014-2015 School Quality Snapshot, 11 percent of students met state standards in English, compared with 30 percent citywide; 19 percent met standards in math, compared with 39 percent.

The Achievement First University Prep High School, one of several Achievement First public charter schools in Bushwick, serves about 275 students from Grades 9 through 12. Its average SAT scores in 2015 were 507 in math, 448 in reading and 478 in writing, versus 466 in math, 444 in reading and 439 in writing citywide. At the Bushwick Leaders High School for Academic Excellence, which serves around 280 students, average SAT scores were 393 in math, 368 in reading and 382 in writing.

The subway trip to Midtown Manhattan takes about 30 minutes. The L train runs along Wyckoff Avenue and to 14th Street in Manhattan. The M train goes to Midtown, the J and Z to Lower Manhattan.

From around the 1890s to 1915, Brooklyn was the beer capital of the United States, and “we had about 45 beer breweries just in Brooklyn,” said Ron Schweiger, the official Brooklyn borough historian since 2002.

That led to the creation of “Brewers’ Row” along Bushwick Avenue, where many of the brewery owners and other industry moguls built large homes.
