A huge installation planned to take over 23 Wall Street, the onetime headquarters of J.P. Morgan and Co., has been canceled after months of struggles with funding.

“The cost of following through at 23 Wall Street is too high and time is too short,” wrote Simon Birch, the primary artist and organizer of the show, called “The 14th Factory,” in a note to his team and advisory board. “And our investors have explained, given these facts, they will not support us. This process has taken a toll on me and I need to step back and regroup.”

A spokeswoman for the project said Mr. Birch was headed to London “for medical purposes.”

The Hong Kong-based artist had initially raised $3 million for the show, which was to open on May 16, including $1 million of his own money. (All art was to be donated and auctioned off after the show, with proceeds going to charity.)

Unable to raise additional funds in New York, Mr. Birch turned to investors in Hong Kong and was able to raise an additional $1.8 million. But that apparently was not enough, despite a postponement and setting an abbreviated run. Getting the show in before the summer was an issue since the Wall Street space, which sprawls over 150,000 square feet, is not air-conditioned.
