OTTAWA — Even as a huge wildfire continues to rage nearby, some residents of Fort McMurray, Alberta, may soon be allowed to return to their city, the province’s premier said on Wednesday.

About 88,000 people fled Fort McMurray, the hub of Canada’s oil sands industry, on May 3, when the wildfire escaped the surrounding forest and ravaged several of the city’s neighborhoods.

Their return is contingent on the restoration of a variety of basic services, and, of course, the fire must no longer pose an imminent threat.

“These timelines — and this is really important — are contingent on these conditions’ being met,” the premier, Rachel Notley, said at a news conference in Edmonton, Alberta. “If conditions change, as they did this week, the voluntary re-entry may be delayed.”

Efforts to get residents back were postponed when a branch of the fire, which now blankets about a million acres, moved up the western side of Fort McMurray earlier this week, then crossed north. Hundreds of people working to reopen a hospital were pulled out. Efforts to restore natural gas lines were also suspended after an explosion that wrecked 10 more homes.

Ms. Notley, however, said that the 911 system was fully operational again, that many shops were free of damage and that electricity had been restored to most areas.

To avoid traffic jams and confusion, people will come back in phases, with those living in neighborhoods with the least amount of damage returning first.

Residents of neighborhoods like Beacon Hill, which was largely wiped out, will be allowed to search the ruins of their homes for items like fireproof strongboxes.

Schools are not scheduled to reopen until September.

Melissa Blake, the city’s mayor, who has been back several times over the past week, warned residents, “What you’re returning to is not what we’ve seen before.”
