Kanye West’s living, breathing, ever-changing seventh album, “The Life of Pablo,” which was released in a wonderfully unpredictable manner this year, is coming to arena stages. Expect an elaborate show.

“My tour game is strong,” Mr. West said in a radio interview after the album’s debut. “My tour game is unprecedented.”

The “Saint Pablo” tour of North America will begin on Aug. 25 in Indianapolis and keep the rapper on the road through Oct. 29, when he is scheduled to play the new T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. Along the way, Mr. West will perform two nights, Sept. 5-6, at Madison Square Garden in New York — where “Pablo” had its premiere with a hybrid fashion show/listening party — as well as two nights in his hometown, Chicago (Oct. 7-8), and two shows in Los Angeles (Oct. 25-26).

Tickets for all 32 dates go on sale Friday via LiveNation.com.

“The Life of Pablo,” which is available only digitally, was released exclusively to the streaming service Tidal in February — a soft launch followed by multiple musical revisions. (His label, Def Jam, called it a “continuous process.”) When the album became available more widely, it made its debut atop the Billboard chart almost entirely based on streams.

Mr. West had been scheduled to give his first major performance of songs from “The Life of Pablo” on the final night of the Governors Ball festival this month, but the event was canceled because of weather. Instead, he appeared briefly at Hot 97’s Summer Jam event and teased a secret, late-night Manhattan concert that same night. An eager crowd congregated on a downtown street until well after 2 a.m., but the show never happened.

On his last arena tour, which supported his 2013 album, “Yeezus,” Mr. West performed wearing a mask alongside bodystocking-clad female dancers and, at one point, an actor portraying Jesus.
