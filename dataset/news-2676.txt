Five people were killed and four others were injured on Tuesday night after a pickup truck plowed into a group of bicyclists on a road about seven miles north of Kalamazoo, Mich., the authorities said.

The crash happened around 7 p.m. near Markin Glen Park on North Westnedge Avenue in Cooper Township, Mich.

The driver fled on foot but was later arrested a short distance away, Jeffrey S. Getting, the prosecuting attorney for Kalamazoo County, said at a news conference on Tuesday. He described the driver as being a 50-year-old man from western Michigan.

Mr. Getting said a decision about what, if any, charges would be filed would be made on Thursday, after an investigation by the Michigan State Police.

Five bicyclists were pronounced dead at the scene, and the others were hospitalized with serious injuries, Mr. Getting said. All of the victims were adults, he said.

Three law enforcement agencies received calls about a pickup truck driving erratically about 30 minutes before the crash, Mr. Getting said.

Bronson Methodist Hospital was treating two patients, Carolyn Wyllie, a hospital spokeswoman, said in an interview on Tuesday night. Borgess Medical Center received two patients, Lew Tysman, a hospital spokesman, said. One patient was in critical condition, and the other was in fair condition, he said.

More details about the four patients were not available.

Markus Eberhard told WOOD-TV that he had been fishing at a park and was leaving when someone yelled for him to watch out. The pickup nearly rolled over his foot, and the bicyclists were hit before he could warn them, he said.

“I saw a bunch of bikes hit the front of his truck, and a couple of them flew,” he told the television station.
