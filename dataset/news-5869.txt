Good evening. Here’s the latest.

1. A Russian who fled his country described overseeing a decade-long doping program that culminated at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi and involved at least 15 medalists. “It was working like a Swiss watch,” he said, detailing a dark-of-night operation to swap out tainted urine samples through a hole in a wall. A Russian official dismissed the account as “a continuation of the information attack on Russian sport.”

2. Donald Trump appeared to have a warmer than expected reception in Washington, a possible signal the party is trying to unite behind him. After his round of closed-door meetings with Republican lawmakers and political leaders, the House speaker, Paul Ryan, praised him as “warm and genuine.” Protesters waiting for him saw little more than his S.U.V. between stops.

_____

3. Turmoil in Brazil intensified as the country’s Senate suspended the deeply unpopular president, Dilma Rousseff. She called the move a coup and swore to win “the struggle for democracy.” Her trial over budgetary irregularities is expected to take months. Leadership now falls to her equally unpopular vice president, Michel Temer, 75, who is much further to the right and has a history of appointing questionable advisers.

_____

4. George Zimmerman, the Floridian who set off national outrage by fatally shooting Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager, made his latest bid to profit from his notoriety. His ad announcing the auction of the gun he used said, “This is a piece of American History.” Social media deriders called the move “sick,” “disgusting” and “beyond tasteless.”

_____

5. The latest disgraced New York politician to be sentenced for corruption: Dean Skelos, the former Republican majority leader of the Senate in Albany. He was given five years in prison and fined more than $500,000 for pressuring firms to provide his son with work, cash and other benefits. The son, Adam, received a prison sentence of six and a half years and a fine.

_____

6. The trial of a second police officer in the death of Freddie Gray began in Baltimore, months after the first ended in a mistrial. Officer Edward Nero was one of three officers who arrested Mr. Gray. His death after a spinal injury suffered while in custody set off violent protests and fueled the national debate over policing and race.

_____

7. Facebook countered claims of bias in the news feeds it sends to its 1.6 billion users, publishing internal guidelines that call for both editors and algorithms to play roles. They show “checks and balances” that “help surface the most important popular stories, regardless of where they fall on the ideological spectrum,” according to a Facebook executive.

_____

8. Joan Rivers’s doctors accepted responsibility for her death in a malpractice settlement reached with her family. The amount was not disclosed. The 81-year-old comedian died after going into cardiac arrest during what was supposed to be a routine throat procedure in 2014.

_____

9. The parents of a toddler dying of leukemia opted to spare him a second bone-marrow transplant. Because they gave up, even rejecting chemo, the cells from the first transplant had enough time to boost his immune system enough to kill the cancer. Above, he played with his older brother. The miraculous case, covered in our best-read story today, comes from a special issue of The Times Magazine on the new science of cancer.

_____

10. Pope Francis said he was open to studying whether women could serve as deacons. Roman Catholic deacons can perform many priestly services, like preaching at Mass and witnessing marriages. “I can’t underscore enough how groundbreaking this is for the church,” a Jesuit theologian said.

_____

11. Finally, the Obama administration took another step to fight global warming, unveiling regulations on methane emissions from new oil and gas wells. And a new study warned that climate change might be killing off a shorebird known as the red knot. The supply of bugs used for food is shrinking at one end of its 9,300-mile migration, and at the other, underdeveloped birds can’t dig out sufficient food.
