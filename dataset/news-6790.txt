“Dawn”

(Loma Vista)

“Dawn,” the new album by the Australian songwriter and producer RY X (born Ry Cuming), floats in a gorgeous, dolorous haze. His voice is a pearly, androgynous tenor, a vessel for liquid melancholy that blurs words at the edges. He stretches pop structures with repetition that grows devotional, obsessive, hypnotic. When he sings about love and desire, he places himself at a confluence of the intimate and the sacred. On “Salt,” he sings:

His music often suggests two other mantric, ethereal songwriters — Jeff Buckley and James Blake — and in a way, RY X has created a bridge between two awkwardly named but emotionally charged genres, psych-folk and future-R&B. An acoustic guitar or slow-moving keyboard chords are usually at the center of his productions. In some places they are all there is, but then echoes open up boundless spaces around him, other instruments waft in and his voice multiplies itself. Dance beats sometimes arrive with a subdued four-on-the-floor thump, as in “Deliverance,” but not always; RY X likes waltzes, too, including “Only,” which starts out folky and turns choirlike and reverential.

Like many other 21st-century ballad singers, RY X has dance-music connections. Between the release in 2013 of his first EP as RY X, “Berlin,” and his new album, he made albums with two electronics-oriented projects, the Acid and Howling. (As Ry Cuming, he also made a self-titled 2010 album of pop-rock songs that only held glimmers of his current style.) But all the other recordings were just groundwork. “Dawn” brings a craftsman’s subliminal assurance to songs that seem to materialize entirely on their own terms, with an organic ebb and flow. “Beacon” starts out as a small string ensemble and then an acoustic, fingerpicked, undulating waltz — “I fall into your mind’s eye,” RY X sings — but by the end it is awash in electric-guitar feedback and his incantatory voice, singing wordless ahs. He’s both supplicant and shaper.
