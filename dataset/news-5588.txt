Obviously you are not supporting actual dog murder any more than you are supporting postapocalyptic gasoline-hoarding biker gangs (wait — you’re not, are you?), or for that matter human murder. I trust that your wife understands this and that even fictional dog murder makes her upset. I feel you are obliged to respect her wishes and skip ahead to “Mad Max: Fury Road,” which, according to your incredible website, features only the eating of a live two-headed C.G.I. lizard — something we can all get behind.
