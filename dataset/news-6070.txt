MCC Theater is best known for its work on contemporary plays, but next year, for only the third time in its history, it will present a musical, and it’s an unusual one: “Ride the Cyclone,” about a group of teenagers making the case for their lives from the Great Beyond after a tragic roller coaster accident.

The musical, which has been much praised in previous stagings, is a highlight of the next season for MCC.

The theater is also presenting the American premier of a new dark comedy written by, and starring, Matthew Perry, the actor best known from the television show “Friends.” The play, “The End of Longing,” ran in London, where it was a commercial success but a critical dud; Mr. Perry is reworking the script for the New York run.

MCC has had a long relationship with the playwright Neil LaBute, and its season will begin in September with a new play by him, “All the Ways to Say I Love You.” The play is a one-woman show, starring Judith Light and directed by Leigh Silverman.

“Ride the Cyclone,” written by Jacob Richmond and Brooke Maxwell, will be directed by Rachel Rockwell, and is to run in November and December. It was previously staged at Chicago Shakespeare Theater, and is being supported by a commercial producer, Kevin McCollum.

MCC will present “Yen,” a play about two teenage brothers that was written by Anna Jordan, with Trip Cullman directing. The play, which was previous presented at the Royal Court Theater in London, will be staged in New York next February.

“The End of Longing,” in which Mr. Perry plays an alcoholic with a motley collection of friends, features Lindsay Posner as its director and is to open next May.
