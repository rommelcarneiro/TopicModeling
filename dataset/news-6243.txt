Good evening. Here’s the latest.

1. Donald Trump’s campaign began taking over much of the Republican National Committee’s financial and political infrastructure. So far largely self-funded, Mr. Trump has no fund-raising infrastructure of his own, but has said he may need up to $1.5 billion for the presidential race.

_____

2. Senator Elizabeth Warren’s recent sharp retorts to Mr. Trump’s Twitter assaults — labeling him a “bully” after he taunted her as “goofy” — suggest that she is embracing the chance to unify Democrats against him. The approach has added to speculation about her becoming a running mate for Hillary Clinton, who has said she wants a vice-presidential candidate who can act as an attack dog.

_____

3. The Justice Department and North Carolina sued each other, escalating their clash over a law limiting public restroom access for transgender people. Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican, said the government was pursuing a “radical reinterpretation” of the Civil Rights Act. Attorney General Loretta Lynch responded, “None of us can stand by when a state enters the business of legislating identity.”

4. Good news for anyone worried about wrinkles: Scientists say they have created a film that works like a “second skin,” returning youthful elasticity to older faces. The film (used on the left above) is made of siloxanes — each molecule links an oxygen atom to two silicon atoms. But don’t add it to your shopping list yet. The material hasn’t been submitted to the F.D.A.

_____

5. Krispy Kreme is on the market, and the company at the front of the line, JAB Holding, added a 25 percent premium to its $1.4 billion offer to take the chain private.

_____

6. A California judge abruptly dismissed a lawsuit challenging the mental competency of the ailing Sumner Redstone, whose vast media empire includes CBS and Viacom. But the flow of salacious details revealed by the plaintiff, a much younger former lover whom Mr. Sumner cut out of his will, may not slow much. Her lawyer is planning to appeal and has filed a $100 million suit against other members of the Redstone family.

_____

7. The Philippines, a major U.S. ally in Southeast Asia, voted for a new president. The front-runner: a blunt-spoken longtime mayor, Rodrigo Duterte, whose campaign included jokes about rape and promises to kill criminals. He offers a strong contrast to the soft-spoken outgoing president, Benigno Aquino III.

_____

8. Our entertainment experts salute the flood of finales as the network TV season ends. One highlight: the last few episodes of the fourth season of “The Americans” (Wednesdays, 10 p.m., FX), “the most arresting, vital drama on TV.” And “Scandal” ends its fifth season Thursday (9 p.m., ABC). The full list of suggestions is here.

_____

9. Confusion reigned in Brazil after the new speaker of the lower house of Congress annulled the vote to impeach President Dilma Rousseff. It appeared that the Senate intended to hold to its plan of deciding on Wednesday whether to suspend and try her for financial actions that hid the depth of the country’s economic problems.

_____

10. Steven Croman, a real-estate investor often on New York City’s “worst landlords” lists, was charged with 20 felonies, including grand larceny and criminal tax fraud. The case is part of a legal campaign by the city and state against landlords who strong-arm rent-regulated tenants out of affordable housing in order to raise rents.

_____

11. Finally, a judge in Mexico ruled that the notorious drug lord known as El Chapo could be extradited to the U.S., where he faces many charges and is less likely to be able to carry out another escape. But a U.S. law enforcement official said any transfer could still be months away.
