Just steps from Fifth Avenue’s shopping bag scrum, you can sip a coffee in quiet luxury, perhaps nibbling a croissant or more substantial panini imagined by Cesare Casella, the consulting chef. The Italian haberdasher Domenico Vacca has outfitted his shiny new American flagship store with an espresso bar (and a barber shop, beauty salon and private club). When the wine license is approved, a late-afternoon stem of sangiovese will be available, too: DV Café, 15 West 55th Street, domenicovacca.com.
