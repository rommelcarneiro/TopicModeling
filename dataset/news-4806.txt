Investigators have found several fire-code violations at the garden supply store in Manhattan where a fuel spill ignited a fire underneath the Metro-North Railroad on Tuesday, causing thousands of commuters to be stranded and lingering disruptions, city officials said on Friday.

The Fire Department said it issued four summonses to the store, Urban Garden Center, which is under the elevated tracks on Park Avenue in East Harlem. Officials said the violations were related to the storage, handling and use of liquefied petroleum gas. They were for using the gas to heat a greenhouse; keeping gasoline in quantities that required a permit, which the store did not have; and unlawfully storing portable fueled equipment.

It is unclear what penalties could result from the summonses. The store did not respond on Friday to phone and email messages seeking comment.

The fire started on Tuesday evening when workers were refilling a generator, fire officials said this week. The blaze erupted, forcing officials to halt train service during the evening rush and limit train service for days.

Metro-North returned to regular service on Friday, although transit officials said commuters should expect some delays.

The fire prompted city officials to question why flammable materials had been kept beneath the tracks.

Natalie Grybauskas, a spokeswoman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, said on Friday that city agencies were “reviewing these areas citywide and working together to ensure the safety of these spaces.” The city owns the property, and a city agency manages a lease held by the Urban Garden Center.

“For the most part,” she said, “spaces under train tracks and viaducts are unoccupied by businesses or structures.”
