Good evening. Here’s the latest.

1. Hillary Clinton and her supporters reveled in her historic status, a day after her primary victories in California and New Jersey all but sealed her presidential nomination. Bernie Sanders vowed to fight on, but laid off half his staff. President Obama will meet with Mr. Sanders on Thursday morning, and aides say the focus will be on nudging him to embrace Mrs. Clinton’s campaign — and bringing his energetic, idealistic supporters with him.

2. Donald Trump now faces an opponent he trails in polls. His support is especially low among college-educated suburban voters in battleground states. He pledged to be worthy of “carrying the mantle,” but some Republican stalwarts fear his missteps and attacks on nationalities and ethnic groups may cost them both the White House and Senate control.

3. The arrest of the influential head of New York City’s corrections union, Norman Seabrook, on fraud charges revealed a surprise asset for federal prosecutors. Court documents showed that a central target in one of several inquiries into Mayor Bill de Blasio’s campaign fund-raising has pleaded guilty to fraud conspiracy and is cooperating with the government.

4. A National Academies of Sciences panel offered guidance on a new, powerful gene editing capacity that offers humans the ability to alter or eliminate populations of organisms, like disease vectors and pests. The report warned of risks but encouraged research on gene drive systems, which ensure that manipulated DNA is passed on to virtually all offspring. “The potential to reduce human suffering and ecological damage demands scientific attention,” a panelist said.

5. The Cavaliers restored some drama to the N.B.A. finals, which started with two lopsided victories by the Warriors. Playing at home for the first time this series, Cleveland notched a commanding 120-90 win and stifled Golden State’s air of invincibility ahead of Game 4 on Friday night.

_____

6. The five-time Grand Slam champion Maria Sharapova said she would appeal “an unfairly harsh two-year suspension” for doping. She noted that the International Tennis Federation penalized her despite accepting her defense: that she did not realize the performance-enhancing heart medication meldonium had been prohibited. She has lost lucrative sponsorships, and this week fell behind Serena Williams as the world’s highest-paid female athlete.

_____

7. Another court statement emerged in the case of the former Stanford student who was sentenced to just six months in jail for sexual assault: a letter to the judge from the defendant himself. In it, Brock Turner says the woman had consented to the encounter, but he admitted “imposing trauma and pain” on her. A childhood friend who wrote him a letter of support that was published this week has seen her band blackballed from Brooklyn venues.

_____

8. India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, addressed a joint meeting of Congress on the second day of a visit meant to signal a new warmth and cooperation. He encouraged the U.S. to keep a military presence in Afghanistan, embraced efforts to counter climate change and condemned global terror. And he praised Silicon Valley for bringing together “the innovative genius of America and India’s intellectual creativity” to invent “industries of the future.”

_____

9. Two Palestinian gunmen posing as restaurant patrons opened fire in a popular Tel Aviv cafe, killing four people and wounding several others. More than two dozen Israelis and two American visitors have been killed in attacks by Palestinian assailants since October.

_____

10. This was a lot less fun than a barrel of monkeys. This small primate, believed to be in the Vervet family, jumped onto machinery at a hydroelectric power station in Kenya, setting off a cascade of tripping transformers that caused a nationwide blackout. The country’s electricity provider, KenGen, said the monkey was handed over to wildlife services.

_____

11. Finally, our dance critic took in Beyoncé’s Formation concert, and found her 20 or so dancers “both a source and a manifestation of her strength.” “A Beyoncé concert is a display of a female power,” he writes, “even when she isn’t singing about girls running the world or telling the audience that ‘there’s no such thing as a weak woman.’ The dancers back up that message, too.”
