Along with opening a bakery, a high-end restaurant and, soon, a food hall, Claus Meyer has found time to carve out a hot-dog stand. It’s outside his restaurant, Agern, in Grand Central Terminal and it sells custom-made beef, pork and chicken sausages in natural casings that are sizzled on a griddle. They come smothered in such Danish-style trappings as onions, raw and fried; rémoulade; slaw; pickles; horseradish; crispy shallots; and ketchup. They are served on whole-grain buns. The chicken, called Hen Hound, needed a pile of toppings; the others had personality to spare. And if a hot dog is not what you want, there’s a companion deli next door that has Danish pastries, sandwiches, salads, candies heavy on licorice and other items like coffee, bread flour and vinegars: Danish Dogs, $7 to $8, Grand Central Terminal, 89 East 42nd Street.
