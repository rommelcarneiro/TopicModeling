President Obama spoke on Friday at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial, where the United States first dropped an atomic bomb on Japan nearly 71 years ago.

In announcing Mr. Obama’s trip this month, the White House said he would not revisit President Harry S. Truman’s decision to drop the bomb or apologize for the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But some New York Times readers who answered our request for suggestions for the president before he gave his speech said he should do just that.

Other readers recalled atrocities committed by Japanese soldiers during World War II and the Japanese empire’s militarism. They suggested that Mr. Obama defend the decision to use atomic weapons to hasten an end to the war and, ultimately, save lives by avoiding an invasion of Japan.

Most of the hundreds of respondents suggested that the president acknowledge the harsh realities of war, underline the increasingly close relationship between the United States and Japan, and look forward to a world free from the threat of nuclear weapons.

Below are selected excerpts from the readers’ responses, lightly edited for length and clarity.
