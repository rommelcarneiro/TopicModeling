A statue of Jesus stolen last weekend from outside the rectory of a Roman Catholic Church in Brooklyn by three laughing thieves has been returned by a young man who said he found it in a nearby trash can.

The SS. Peter and Paul Church in the Williamsburg neighborhood had appealed for the return of the statue on Thursday after reviewing surveillance video that showed the thieves taking it from its pedestal outside the church rectory at 71 South Third Street on April 30. In the video, a young woman wearing ballet-style flats lifts the statue off its base and tucks it under her right arm, laughing with her companions as they run away.

The statue, a plaster mold, had replaced a ceramic version that was stolen from in front of the rectory in 2012 and never found.

Carolyn Erstad, a spokeswoman for the Diocese of Brooklyn, said on Friday that a young man found the replacement statue in a trash can a few blocks from the rectory on the same night it was stolen. He gave it to his mother, Ms. Erstad said, “but when they saw news reports and realized where the statue belonged, they called the church and returned it.”

The statue’s right hand and base were damaged, said Mother Maria Bendita, the mother superior of the Williamsburg parish to which the church belongs. It was taken for restoration to a company in Mount Kisco, N.Y., whose owner planned to give the church a new, heavier statue to put outside the rectory, she said. The older one will go inside the church’s new building, scheduled for completion in 2019, she said.

The police said on Friday that there had been no arrests in the case. Mother Bendita said she would like to hear from the thieves who took it.

“What they did, it had consequences,” she said. “They stole something that was sacred for us, so we’d really like to see what they have to say.”
