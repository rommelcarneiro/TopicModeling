Sutton Foster, who has spent the past five years in leading roles on Broadway (“Violet”) and TV (“Younger”), is heading Off Broadway to star in a revival of “Sweet Charity” for the New Group this fall.

The 1966 musical — with music by Cy Coleman, lyrics by Dorothy Fields and a book by Neil Simon — is among four productions planned for the New Group’s 2016-17 season, the company announced Wednesday.

Joshua Bergasse (“On the Town”) will create all-new choreography for “Sweet Charity,” whose original production won a Tony for its choreography by Bob Fosse. Leigh Silverman will direct Ms. Foster in the title role of an eternally optimistic dance-hall hostess.

Kevin McCollum, the Broadway producer who worked with the New Group for the first staging of “Avenue Q” in 2003, will be a co-producer on “Sweet Charity.” In an interview, Scott Elliott, the New Group’s artistic director, said his company occasionally brings in commercial producers like Mr. McCollum to help underwrite shows — often musicals — that far exceed the typical budget of a New Group production.

The season, which will be presented at the Pershing Square Signature Center, also includes “All the Fine Boys,” written and directed by Erica Schmidt (“A Month in the Country”); the New York premiere of Wallace Shawn’s play “Evening at the Talk House,” which recently ended its run at the National Theater in London; and “The Whirligig,” the actor Hamish Linklater’s follow-up to his 2013 playwriting debut, “The Vandal.”

Mr. Elliott, a longtime collaborator with Mr. Shawn, will direct his play, as well as Mr. Linklater’s. Mr. Elliott called “The Whirligig” “deeply personal” and said “it’s one of the most glorious plays I’ve read in recent memory.” So far, the cast includes Zosia Mamet (“Girls”) and Maura Tierney (“The Affair”).
