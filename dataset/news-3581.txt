The French Cheese Board, which operated a storefront briefly as a trial balloon in the garment district, has returned with a more elaborate setup in SoHo. The new location from this trade group offers a changing selection of cheeses for sampling and sale; accessories like boards, knives, honeys and preserves; a kitchen for demonstrations and lessons; and an art gallery: French Cheese Board, 41 Spring Street (Mulberry Street), frenchcheeseboard.com.
