The family of the bartender, Marques Gaines, 32, has filed a wrongful-death and negligence lawsuit against several businesses and taxi companies in his Feb. 7 death. The video shows him talking with other people outside a store before getting into a confrontation with a man who shoves him. Mr. Gaines is punched and falls to the ground. Several people are then seen approaching him. The Chicago Tribune reported that Mr. Gaines’s family said his cellphone and debit card were stolen. Police said they could not confirm he was robbed. Several other people ignore Mr. Gaines before a taxi turning onto the street runs over his body. Relatives said they hoped witnesses would help identify the attacker. (AP)

Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Thursday saved Arkansas’s Medicaid expansion by voiding part of a budget bill that would have ended the subsidized insurance for more than 250,000 poor people. Mr. Hutchinson, a Republican, vetoed a provision that ordered a Dec. 31 end to the program, which uses federal funds to purchase private insurance for the poor. Arkansas was the first state to win approval for its hybrid Medicaid program, created three years ago as an alternative to expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Some Republicans had tried to block the program by refusing to approve a Medicaid budget bill that funded it. To get around them, the governor and legislative leaders devised a parliamentary move that required supporters of the program to back a provision ending it. Then Mr. Hutchinson used his veto to strike the end date for the program, which keeps it alive. Opponents are unlikely to be able to override the veto. (AP)
