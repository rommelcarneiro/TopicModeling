It is not just rockers like Bruce Springsteen and Ringo Starr who have canceled their concerts in North Carolina to protest the state’s law limiting transgender bathroom access and pre-empting local governments from passing anti-discrimination ordinances.

The violin virtuoso Itzhak Perlman, one of the biggest names in classical music, announced on Tuesday that he would cancel his Wednesday concert with the North Carolina Symphony as, he said in a statement on his Facebook page, “a stand against House Bill 2,” as the new law is called.

“As my fans know, I have spent a lifetime advocating against discrimination toward those with physical disabilities and have been a vocal advocate for treating all people equally,” Mr. Perlman, who contracted polio as a child and often performs from a wheelchair, said in the statement. He cited remarks that Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch made recently when she announced that the Justice Department was challenging the law; she said that the issue was “about the dignity and respect we accord our fellow citizens.”

Mr. Perlman said, “I couldn’t agree more, and will look forward to returning to North Carolina when this discriminatory law is repealed.”

The symphony said on its web page that it would contact patrons about their tickets. “The North Carolina Symphony welcomes all people with our hearts and minds open and we are honored to share our music-making with everyone,” it said in a statement.
