When the Mets had Steven Matz skip a start over the weekend, the cause sounded ominous: elbow soreness. In this age of fragile pitching arms, it is easy to imagine the worst.

But the Mets got good news on Monday when the left-handed Matz visited a doctor and was found to have no ligament damage in his throwing elbow, according to a person who was briefed on the matter. The person requested anonymity because the Mets made no formal announcement.

Matz, who turns 25 this month, has had a nearly seamless beginning to his major league career, going 9-1 with a 2.56 E.R.A. in 12 starts — six last season, six this season. But he had Tommy John surgery once, in 2010, and a pitcher’s chances of success decline greatly after a second such operation.

Matz last pitched last Monday in Los Angeles, beating the Dodgers for his fifth win in a row. He allowed only four runs across 33 innings in those starts.

The Mets have not said when Matz’s next start will be, but because of Monday’s day off, they could conceivably push it back to Saturday — at Citi Field against Milwaukee — while keeping their other starters on regular rest.
