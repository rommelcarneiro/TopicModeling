May’s album chart belonged to Drake.

Drake’s latest release, “Views” (Young Money/Cash Money/Republic), holds the top spot on Billboard’s latest chart for a fourth week in a row, dominating the rankings ever since the album was released on April 29. This week it faced close competition from new records by Ariana Grande and Blake Shelton, but beat them thanks to what continue to be extraordinary streaming numbers.

In its latest week, “Views” had just 50,000 sales in the United States as a complete album, according to Nielsen — far less than new releases by Ms. Grande, whose “Dangerous Woman” (Republic) had 129,000 sales, and Mr. Shelton’s “If I’m Honest” (Warner Bros. Nashville), with 153,000. Downloads of individual songs also factor into the overall chart position, and by that measurement “Views” was not exceptional; its 274,000 track downloads were only slightly ahead of the 201,000 for “Dangerous Woman.”

But for a fourth week straight, “Views” really pulled ahead in streaming. Its songs had 166.2 million streams in its latest week, compared with 38.6 million for “Dangerous Woman” and just 3.9 million for “If I’m Honest.” When combined with album and track sales, “Views” led the chart with 189,000 “album equivalent units,” in the latest chartspeak, compared to 175,000 for “Dangerous Woman” and 170,000 for “If I’m Honest.” (In Britain, Ms. Grande’s album squeaked past Drake by a margin of just 600 equivalent sales.)

Also this week, Beyoncé’s “Lemonade” (Parkwood/Columbia) is No. 4, Rihanna’s “Anti” (Roc Nation) is No. 5, and two new albums by rock elders open high on the chart: Eric Clapton’s new “I Still Do” (Bushbranch/Surfdog) starts at No. 6, and Bob Dylan’s latest collection of standards, “Fallen Angels” (Columbia), bows at No. 7.
