Fascinated by “impossible bouquets,” the Dutch Baroque still-life paintings that took years to complete because each flower could only be painted while in season, the Régime des Fleurs perfumers Alia Raza and Ezra Woods have recreated the art form — with a treat for the senses. “It’s our goal to bring a sense of floralcy to everything — that includes food,” Raza says. Their first foray into “edible experiences” was with Timelapse, a fragrance made with food-grade botanical extractions and alcohol — available in the Régime des Fleurs Spritz, a gin-prosecco cocktail at Dimes. Now the duo has collaborated with Burrow bakery’s Ayako Kurokawa on a scented and flavored cookie, as part of Régime des Fleurs’s ongoing Artefact program of collaborations. “We used essences that can be used for both perfumery and flavoring,” says Woods. “It’s meant to be tasty but subtle — and hard to put your finger on.” The dough and icing are subtly infused with notes of bergamot, orange, elderflower and almond to conjure up the uplifting feelings Kurokawa’s hand-painted watercolor-like bouquets represents. Each cookie is made to order in Brooklyn, and takes about a day and a half to complete.
