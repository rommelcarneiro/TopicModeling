How does a brick-and-mortar store stay relevant in the age of online shopping? James Brown, the founder of the high-fashion boutique Hostem in London’s Shoreditch neighborhood, is leading the way with the New Road Residence, a wisteria-clad Georgian townhouse in nearby Whitechapel that he’s converted into a kind of concept shop and art gallery that can be rented for overnight stays. It’s an in situ showroom of the best that money can buy: top-flight furniture by Max Lamb and Hans Wagner; art supplied by the Stuart Shave/Modern Art gallery; a library selected by a King’s College professor and a wine cellar stocked by the chef and manager at London’s Primeur. Purchase of just about everything can be arranged, and should you fall in love with the house’s chopping boards (Black Creek Mercantile), crystal stemware (Lobmeyr) or bed linens (Once Milano), you can take them home immediately, from the mini-store located in the boot room. Asks Brown, “Can the Internet really compete with that?”
