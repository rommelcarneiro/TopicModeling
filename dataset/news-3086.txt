The Northside Festival, Brooklyn’s answer to South by Southwest, keeps expanding. Its music component offers a pass to shows at more than two dozen clubs from Thursday, June 9, through Sunday, June 12, for $94.24; tickets for individual shows are also available.

The lineup teems with New York City acts: psych-folk from Steve Gunn on Thursday at Music Hall of Williamsburg (9 p.m., $13) or Weyes Blood at the same club on Saturday (10 p.m., $10); the pioneering hip-hop D.J. Grandmaster Flash at McCarren Park on Friday at 6 p.m. (free with R.S.V.P.); noisy power-trio math-rock and improvisations from the guitarist Yonatan Gat at Aviv (Thursday at 9 p.m. with pass) and Baby’s All Right (Saturday at 7:45, $12).

But it’s not all local: There’s country and Americana from Kacey Musgraves, Conor Oberst and the Felice Brothers at McCarren Park on Saturday (6:30 p.m., $40.74), and, in a booking coup, Brian Wilson will perform “Pet Sounds” on Sunday at McCarren Park (6:30, $40.74).
