How does a responsibly repressed therapist become that woman — you know, the kind who guts her already dysfunctional family by sleeping with the ones they love? Last season on Hulu’s “Casual,” Valerie (Michaela Watkins) was left by her husband for a younger woman; packed up her precocious teenage daughter, Laura (Tara Lynne Barr), moved in with her brother, Alex (Tommy Dewey), a dating-site creator; and went a bit bonkers as she navigated singledom with him as her wingman. The show left us as Alex discovered Valerie after she had an Ecstasy-fueled encounter with his girlfriend; before that, she had sex with Laura’s teacher crush.

Season 2, debuting Tuesday, June 7, finds a perplexed Valerie wondering how it all went so wrong, while Laura and Alex try to blunt their anger and pain. “I’m kind of trying to distance myself from that word, ‘hate,’ verbally and emotionally,” Alex tells his sister. “How’s that working for you?” she asks. “So far happiness is kind of boring,” he says. Good thing “Casual” is not.
