New comedies, a German spy series, a hacker thriller and an unsparing African war drama were among the television honorees in the 75th Peabody Awards. The awards, recognizing the best in electronic media, are bestowed annually by the University of Georgia’s Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication. The works below won awards in the entertainment and children’s programming category on Friday.

Netflix won three Peabodys, including for “Beasts of No Nation,” a movie about child soldiers in Africa; “Master of None,” Aziz Ansari’s comedy about self-obsessed young adults in New York; and “Marvel’s Jessica Jones,” a moody superhero crime drama starring Krysten Ritter.

“Black-ish,” the ABC sitcom with a socially conscious edge, was also among the winners. Other honored comedies included “Unreal,” Lifetime’s reality-TV satire that, like “Master of None,” won for its inaugural season; and “Transparent,” the acclaimed Amazon series about a gender-transitioning paterfamilias.

“Mr. Robot,” a twisty USA Network drama about hacker culture and corporate misbehavior, and “Deutschland 83,” a period German espionage thriller, also won Peabodys for their first seasons. Other drama winners included “The Leftovers,” the metaspiritual HBO series; and “Wolf Hall,” the PBS period mini-series based on Hilary Mantel’s Booker Prize-winning novel.

Rounding out the TV winners was “Katie Morag,” the BBC adaptation of Mairi Hedderwick’s popular children’s books.

Winners of news, radio/podcast, web and public service Peabodys, announced earlier this week, included “This American Life,” NPR News and “Real Sports With Bryant Gumbel.” Awards for documentary and education works will be announced April 26.
