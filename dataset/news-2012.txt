The Tony Awards ceremony had its highest ratings in 15 years on Sunday night, with nearly nine million viewers tuning in to CBS.

Viewership was fueled by the popularity of the hit “Hamilton,” which won 11 Tonys. The ceremony was also broadcast within 18 hours of the mass shooting in Orlando, Fla., giving award-winners and presenters a platform to address a national tragedy.

The host, James Corden, opened the ceremony with a poignant, 45-second speech addressing the shooting. “Hate will never win,” he said. “Together we have to make sure of that. Tonight’s show stands as a symbol and a celebration of that principle.”

The show then kicked off with a “Hamilton” spoof, with Mr. Corden, host of CBS’s “The Late Late Show,” at the center.

The 8.7 million viewers represented a 35 percent jump over last year, which drew 6.5 million.

In an interview last week with The New York Post, CBS’s chief executive, Leslie Moonves, said that the Tonys were a “money loser” for the network but that it had no intention of dropping the broadcast. “ I know this sounds corny, but part of being a broadcaster is public trust,” he said in the interview. “And I believe it is important for us to show America what is happening on Broadway.”
