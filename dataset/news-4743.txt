Susana Santos Silva, a young trumpeter from Porto, Portugal, is a fearless jazz musician who can determine a context for herself wherever she is. She plays with a warm tone and a mute until she wants to recast it for the ensemble and the space she’s playing in; she’s equally comfortable with carefully measured phrases as she is with relaxed free improvisation. She’s in town as part of the Orquestra Jazz de Matosinhos, a big band that works with the jazz guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel at the Blue Note through the week leading up to Sunday, May 22, and then she’s doing a run of small Brooklyn gigs with some of the best improvisers in town. On Monday, she’s at 65 Fen, with the bassist Pascal Niggenkemper and the drummer Carlo Costa; on Tuesday, at Korzo, with the bassist Thomas Morgan and pianist Craig Taborn; on Thursday, she’ll play in a duo with the saxophonist Ingrid Laubrock at Manhattan Inn; and on May 29, she’ll play in a trio with the pianist Kris Davis and the violist Mat Maneri at IBeam.
