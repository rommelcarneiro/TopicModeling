Can Amazon buck the gloomy tech earnings season?

For the last week and a half, many tech companies — including Apple and Microsoft — have reported quarterly financial results that have been weaker than expected. Only a few of the giant tech firms have emerged unscathed, with Facebook the prime example.

On Wednesday, the social network said it had tripled profit from a year earlier, writes Mike Isaac. Facebook also accompanied the results with a proposal for a third class of shares to cement the control of its founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg.

Now it is Amazon’s turn. The giant online retailer is scheduled to post earnings on Thursday. Investors are set to examine Amazon’s thriving cloud computing business, as well as the company’s profit (or lack thereof) as it spends heavily on new initiatives. In a shareholder letter earlier this month, Amazon’s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, vowed to keep swinging for the fences and to keep inventing.

“Big winners pay for so many experiments,” Mr. Bezos wrote.
