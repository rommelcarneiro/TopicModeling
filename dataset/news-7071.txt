South Korea’s Olympic committee last week unveiled uniforms infused with mosquito repellent that officials say will help protect athletes from the Zika virus at this year’s games in Rio de Janeiro.

The outfits all feature long pants, long-sleeved shirts and jackets. The clothes are to be worn by athletes during ceremonies, training and at the athletes’ village.

South Korean officials said they couldn’t alter the uniforms worn during competition itself because of strict rules and performance concerns.

Officials in the United States also unveiled closing ceremony outfits for the athletes by Polo Ralph Lauren. The Americans don’t seem quite as worried about the Zika epidemic: The team will be wearing white twill shorts to the closing ceremony.
