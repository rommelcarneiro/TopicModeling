Amid growing concern about a lengthy closing of the L train tunnel between Manhattan and Brooklyn, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said on Monday that a shutdown would not start until early 2019.

Officials at the authority have not said whether they will shut down the entire tunnel or close one tube at a time and continue to run some trains while they repair damage from Hurricane Sandy. But residents who live along the booming L train route are worried about the effect of a closing that could last more than a year.

At an authority board committee meeting on Monday, transit officials outlined reconstruction plans for the tunnel, which has two tubes under the East River and is known as the Canarsie tunnel. They announced that the first public meeting on the project was scheduled for May 5 in Brooklyn.

The authority’s chairman, Thomas F. Prendergast, said the meeting was the start of a “robust community engagement effort” to receive feedback about the different options for construction work.

“The heavy damage” that the Canarsie tunnel sustained during the hurricane, he said in a statement, “requires that we undertake a full reconstruction in order to ensure the integrity of the tunnel and the safety of our riders for generations to come.”

A second meeting will take place in Manhattan later in May, officials said. The Canarsie tunnel, one of several tunnels damaged in the 2012 storm, has more than 300,000 riders each weekday.

A presentation to the board featured photos of the flood damage, including crumbling walls and exposed cables. Workers must reconstruct 2.7 miles of track, replace more than 50 miles of cables and repair a pump room, among other fixes. Officials said they planned to award a contract for the work by the end of this year.
