Members of Congress and the news media often go at one another in the hallways of the Capitol, but this week they will be taking it to the softball diamond as well.

The annual Congressional Women’s Softball Game will take place Wednesday evening, pitting members of the House and Senate against a team made up of representatives from news organizations including CNN, The Huffington Post, NBC, The Los Angeles Times, Roll Call, NPR, Politico, PBS and, ahem, The New York Times.

Among lawmakers on the bipartisan, bicameral roster are Senators Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Joni Ernst of Iowa, all Republicans, and Senators Kirsten E. Gillibrand of New York and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, both Democrats. House members include Representatives Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, Cheri Bustos of Illinois and Donna Edwards of Maryland, all Democrats, along with Representatives Renee Ellmers of North Carolina, Mia Love of Utah, Martha E. McSally of Arizona and Kristi Noem of South Dakota, all Republicans.

Since its inception in 2009, the game has raised more than $700,000 for the Young Survival Coalition, an organization for women age 40 and under who have breast cancer.

The game will be played at the Watkins Recreation Center, not far from the Capitol, and the news media representatives are hoping to put an end to the lawmakers’ mini-winning streak.
