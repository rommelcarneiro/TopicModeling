“Tuck Everlasting” and “American Psycho” are struggling at the Broadway box office after opening to mixed reviews and failing to win best-musical Tony nominations.

“Tuck Everlasting,” adapted from the beloved children’s book about a girl’s encounter with an immortal family, has been stuck at the bottom of the box office barrel since beginning performances on March 31. It grossed $282,911 last week, just 25 percent of its potential. That’s well below what it costs to run a large-scale Broadway musical.

And the grosses for “American Psycho,” adapted from the polarizing Bret Easton Ellis novel about a homicidal investment banker, tumbled 17 percent, to $492,703, during the week that ended Sunday, according to figures released on Monday by the Broadway League.

There was good news for several other shows. A revival of “The Color Purple” had a particularly strong week, grossing $967,352, as theatergoers flocked to see the final performances featuring Jennifer Hudson, who left the show on Sunday.

And three of the season’s new musicals — “Waitress,” “On Your Feet!” and “Shuffle Along, or, The Making of the Musical Sensation of 1921 and All That Followed” — performed well, grossing over $900,000 each. But all were dwarfed by the season’s biggest hit, “Hamilton,” which grossed $1.8 million, behind only the long-running industry leader, “The Lion King,” at $2 million.

Last week was the final week for “Disaster!,” a new musical that closed early because of weak ticket sales; that show grossed $387,184, an improvement over the previous weeks.

Overall, the 37 shows on Broadway last week grossed $27.6 million, down from $28.3 million the previous week, when New York City schoolchildren were on vacation. Box office grosses for the current Broadway season, which ends in two weeks, are 0.8 percent ahead of last season, while attendance is up 1.7 percent.
