Images, too, transcend language. Roberts’s forthcoming book, “Courts 02” (a sequel to his “Courts 01,” published in 2012), contains pastel-tinged pictures of grounds used for basketball games or tennis matches. He continued to hunt for sparse lots in densely packed cities, but the second installment is “more refined” and captured from different angles, he says. “I also study the light at certain times of the year. In New York, for example, I waited for autumn when the leaves are a fiery red to get a burst of subtle color against the raw exterior of a building, and I took one of the images in the winter after a blizzard and the snow added a gentleness.”

In spite of the seemingly idyllic scenes, the predominant theme for Roberts is imperfection. “When you walk into a space and the garden and the building are meticulous, and the door is perfectly painted, it lacks a soul; it lacks a human element,” he says. “Whether the gate is slightly open or there’s a lamp on in the back of the building, there’s always a subtle wink in these photographs that someone’s just been there” — a presence that can be more easily felt with Roberts’s release of three larger, limited-edition posters.
