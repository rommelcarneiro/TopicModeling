Kaci Loren Lindhorst and Adam Jarett Sokoloff were married June 18. Rabbi Lisa Rubin officiated at the Bryant Park Grill, a restaurant in New York.

Mrs. Sokoloff, 28, is a producer, booking guests for “CBS This Morning” in New York. She graduated from Syracuse. She is a daughter of Steven S. Lindhorst of Tarpon Springs, Fla., and Rana L. Schmidt of Edwardsville, Ill.

Mr. Sokoloff, 30, oversees the trading and operations of energy stocks for Key Group Holdings, a hedge fund in Rye, N.Y. He also graduated from Syracuse and received an M.B.A. from Fordham. He is a son of Sandie R. Sokoloff and Jeff M. Sokoloff of Merrick, N.Y.

In August 2010, shortly after the bride graduated from college, the couple met as a result of Facebook, and her roommate’s matchmaking prowess. Ms. Lindhorst agreed to send a friend request to Mr. Sokoloff after the roommate told her about meeting a “really attractive guy” in the building elevator.
