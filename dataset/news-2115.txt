OAKLAND, Calif. — The N.B.A. suspended the Golden State Warriors’ Draymond Green for Game 5 of the N.B.A. finals on Monday as a result of an accumulation of flagrant fouls over the course of the postseason.

The N.B.A. announced Sunday that the league had retroactively assessed Green with a flagrant foul 1 for striking the Cleveland Cavaliers’ LeBron James in the groin during the fourth quarter of the Warriors’ Game 4 victory on Friday, triggering an automatic one-game suspension, per league rules.

Four flagrant foul “points” in the postseason results in a suspension. Green, who plays an outsize role for the Warriors as a do-everything point forward, already had three.

“The cumulative points system is designed to deter flagrant fouls in our game,” Kiki Vandeweghe, the N.B.A.’s executive vice president for basketball operations, said in a statement. “While Draymond Green’s actions in Game 4 do not merit a suspension as a stand-alone act, the number of flagrant points he has earned triggers a suspension for Game 5.”

The Warriors, who will host Game 5, have a three-games-to-one lead in the best-of-seven series.
