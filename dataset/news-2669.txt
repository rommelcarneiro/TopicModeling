Just as New York bids adieu to Cindy Sherman’s 1920s-inspired exhibition at Metro Pictures, Los Angeles welcomes her with a landmark survey at The Broad — the artist’s first in the city in 20 years. “Cindy Sherman: Imitation of Life” pulls from the private museum’s extensive holdings to draw out the cinematic tendencies of the art world’s favorite shapeshifter. Following Sherman from early days onward, the exhibition teases out her fascination with classic cinema and performance. The Broad brought in the independent curator Philipp Kaiser — who was recently tapped for the Swiss Pavilion at the 2017 Venice Biennale — to oversee the much-anticipated show.

While the majority of the materials are archival, Sherman also created two new wall murals that wrap the corners of the Diller Scofidio + Renfro-designed museum. Informed by her “Rear Screen Projection” series from the early 1980s (the artist’s first foray into color photography), these gigantic self-portraits bring to mind the scale of Hollywood as well as the artistic movements that have continually mined its grandiose clichés. Like everything Sherman touches, the wall-climbing prints are immaculately constructed and perfectly dramatic. “In the beginning, when we decided the show would emphasize the cinematic, I encouraged Cindy to revisit the ‘Rear Screen Projections,’” Kaiser explains. “We agreed it would be nice to have some kind of screen in the show — we couldn’t decide if it should be a literal cinema, an image or an installation. What Cindy came up with is a nice hybrid.” Here, in a 30-second time lapse that condenses about six full hours of work, The Broad’s crew leaps into action to get one of the larger-than-life self-portraits ready for their red-carpet debut.
