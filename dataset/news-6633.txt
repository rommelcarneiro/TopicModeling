WASHINGTON — President Obama commuted the sentences of 58 nonviolent drug offenders on Thursday, the latest in a series of efforts to address what he has called the overly long and harsh sentences of an earlier era.

Most of the prisoners whose sentences will be cut short were serving decades behind bars for drug possession and distribution, the result of a crackdown on drug-related crimes in the 1980s and ’90s that affected many African-Americans and other minorities.

The president has commuted the sentences of 306 individuals — more than his six most recent predecessors combined. But Mr. Obama said that his efforts alone were not enough. He urged members of Congress to keep working toward legislation that would change federal sentencing laws, particularly mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenses.

“It just doesn’t make sense to require a nonviolent drug offender to serve 20 years, or in some cases, life, in prison,” Mr. Obama said in a statement.

“An excessive punishment like that doesn’t fit the crime. It’s not serving taxpayers, and it’s not making us safer.”

White House officials have said that Mr. Obama intends to keep working through a backlog of thousands of prisoners who have sought commutations of long sentences for drug-related crimes.

“As a country, we have to make sure that those who take responsibility for their mistakes are able to transition back to their communities,” Mr. Obama said. “It’s the right thing to do. It’s the smart thing to do. And it’s something I will keep working to do as long as I hold this office.”

While sponsors of the legislation in Congress have won some new support in recent weeks, the effort remains stalled.

“While I will continue to review clemency applications,” Mr. Obama said, “only Congress can bring about the lasting changes we need to federal sentencing.”
