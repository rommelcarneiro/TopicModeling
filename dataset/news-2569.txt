MANILA, Philippines — Abu Sayyaf militants in the Philippines have freed four Malaysian sailors more than two months after they were abducted off Borneo island.

Maj. Filemon Tan, a Philippine military spokesman in the city of Zamboanga, said the four crew members were released early Wednesday and immediately taken by speedboat to Sandakan in the Malaysian state of Sabah on Borneo.

Media reports have said the Abu Sayyaf militants demanded 18 million ringgit, or $4.5 million, for the release of the four men, who were kidnapped from their tugboat on April 1. It could not be confirmed if any ransom was paid.

In April, Abu Sayyaf militants beheaded a Canadian hostage, John Ridsdel, after they failed to receive a large ransom by a deadline they had set. Three other people who were kidnapped with Mr. Ridsdel last September — another Canadian, a Norwegian and a Filipino — are still being held.

More than a dozen foreign and Filipino hostages remain in the hands of the Abu Sayyaf, including a Dutch bird-watcher who was kidnapped more than three years ago.

Both the United States and the Philippines have labeled Abu Sayyaf a terrorist organization.

Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines agreed last month to increase maritime security after a rise in kidnappings at sea by militants suspected of being members of Abu Sayyaf.
