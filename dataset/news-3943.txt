John McEnroe is set to become the latest former Grand Slam champion to join the coaching ranks. He plans to join the team of Milos Raonic of Canada for the coming grass-court season, including Wimbledon, where McEnroe won the men’s singles title in 1981, 1983 and 1984.

McEnroe announced the move on Eurosport, the pan-European sports channel, while playing guitar. One of Raonic’s coaches, Riccardo Piatti, later confirmed it in an email message.

“We are very happy about it,” Piatti said. “Besides the experience and knowledge, we think this is going to help Milos win more matches by using his net game.”

McEnroe, now 57 and still active on the senior circuit, was one of the game’s best and most instinctive volleyers, as well as a great doubles player.

Raonic, a 25-year-old with one of the game’s most intimidating serves, reached the semifinals at Wimbledon in 2014 but has not advanced past the third round in his other four appearances.

Piatti said that he would work alongside McEnroe in the grass-court lead-up to Wimbledon and that McEnroe would then work alongside Raonic’s other coach, Carlos Moya, during Wimbledon. Both McEnroe and Moya were once ranked No. 1.
