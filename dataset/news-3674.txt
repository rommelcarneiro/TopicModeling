Two mysterious stone rings found deep in a French cave were probably built by Neanderthals about 176,500 years ago, proving that the ancient cousins of humans were capable of more complex behavior than previously thought, scientists say.

The structures were made from hundreds of stalagmites chopped to a similar length and laid out in two oval patterns up to 16 inches high. The notion that Neanderthals could have made them defies long-held assumptions that these hominids were incapable of the complex behavior necessary to work underground.

Using sophisticated dating techniques, a team led by archaeologist Jacques Jaubert of the University of Bordeaux, France, found that the stalagmites must have been broken off the ground around 176,500 years ago, “making these edifices among the oldest known well-dated constructions made by humans.”

The oval structures may have served some symbolic or ritual purpose, Dr. Jaubert said.

Wil Roebroeks, a Neanderthal expert at the University of Leiden, Netherlands, called the rings “an intriguing find, which underlines that a lot of Neanderthal material culture, including their ‘architecture,’ simply did not survive in the open.”

Dr. Roebroeks, who wasn’t involved in the study, said the fact that similar rings hadn’t been found anywhere else made it hard to test any theory about how they came to be.
