Susan Delvalle, a veteran administrator for New York arts institutions, has been chosen as the new president and executive director of Creative Capital, a group known for applying the principles of venture capital to financing artists’ projects.

Ms. Delvalle, whose appointment is effective June 1, succeeds Ruby Lerner, who has run Creative Capital since it was founded in 1999. Previously, she served as executive director of the Sugar Hill Children’s Museum of Art & Storytelling, as well as director of external affairs and development at El Museo del Barrio.

In an interview, Ms. Delvalle said she was excited for the career change, which takes her from working with institutions to the artists themselves. Creative Capital selects a class of artists each year and awards them $50,000 in funding, as well as roughly $45,000 worth of career development services. “There’s a lot of hand-holding,” Ms. Delvalle said, praising Creative Capital’s approach, “and you rarely find that in other types of grants.”

This year Creative Capital awarded nearly $4.4 million to 46 artistic projects focused on social issues pertaining to race, gun violence and gender identity. Previous winners have included the Oscar-winning documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras, the choreographer Kyle Abraham and the downtown performance stalwart Meredith Monk.

Ms. Lerner announced her plans to step down in 2015. Her departure won’t be much of a retirement, though. “I’m going to see if there’s a book in Creative Capital,” she said, and added that she would begin two jobs in January: as the inaugural Herberger Institute policy fellow at Arizona State University, and as the first senior fellow at the Patty Disney Center for Life and Work at the California Institute of the Arts.
