Just a week after the Metropolitan Museum of Art announced that it was seeking to reduce its staff, the Museum of Modern Art is quietly doing the same.

The museum has offered voluntary buyouts to employees 55 or older with at least nine years of service as of July 31. MoMA said the move was the result of its coming expansion and renovation, which will curtail the museum’s activities.

“The museum is in a transitional stage in terms of the scope of its operations, which are at a reduced level during the renovation period,” it said in a statement. “The program is entirely voluntary and is intended to benefit staff who are considering retirement this year.”

The buyouts come even as MoMA has just received $100 million from the entertainment mogul David Geffen toward its building project.
