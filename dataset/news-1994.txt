It turns out that winning 11 Tony Awards wasn’t the only milestone for “Hamilton” on Sunday.

The musical also wrapped up its biggest box office week ever, grossing over $2 million for the first time.

The grosses for “Hamilton” are likely to continue to rise over time, because the show raised prices for a new block of tickets released Sunday night, just after the Tonys broadcast. The tickets, which included premium seats for a record $849, sold strongly overnight; the show’s producer said Monday that the production went through the purchases to flush out any bought in excess of limits, canceling those sales and putting the tickets back on sale.

“Hamilton” still lags behind the industry leader, “The Lion King,” which has proved amazingly dominant over more than 18 years on Broadway. During the week that ended June 12, “The Lion King” grossed $2,071,899, just ahead of the $2,028,208 earned by “Hamilton,” according to figures released Monday by the Broadway League.

Over all, it was a strong week for Broadway, as pleasant weather and vacationing families increased attendance. The 35 shows running last week grossed $28,477,730, up from $27,019,163 grossed by 36 shows the previous week.

Six other shows grossed over $1 million: “Wicked,” “Aladdin,” “The Book of Mormon,” “Paramour,” “School of Rock” and “Waitress.” For “Waitress,” a musical featuring songs by Sara Bareilles, it was the best week yet, and the show reported strong sales on Monday in the wake of a performance on the Tonys by its star, Jessie Mueller.

The play “Blackbird,” starring Jeff Daniels and Michelle Williams, closed on Saturday, after the strongest week of its run, grossing $552,394.

The Tonys did not offer much comfort to many shows — the awards were concentrated on the musicals “Hamilton” and “The Color Purple” and the play “The Humans” — so other shows will now look to marketing and word-of-mouth to bolster their outreach to audiences.
