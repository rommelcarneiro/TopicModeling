A 21-year-old man was sentenced this week to 18 years to life in prison for a 2011 attack in Queens in which he and five other teenage boys killed a man by stomping on him and beating him, prosecutors said on Wednesday.

The man, Alex Velez, pleaded guilty last month in State Supreme Court in Queens to first-degree manslaughter, and is the fourth person to be sentenced in connection with the March 12, 2011, attack, prosecutors said. The three others, who all pleaded guilty to assault-related charges and were sentenced in 2013, faced penalties ranging from four to 16 years in prison. Two others have not yet been tried.

Mr. Velezâ€™s lawyer did not immediately return a message seeking comment.

Anthony Collao, an 18-year-old from Long Island, was leaving a party at a house early in the morning in the Woodhaven neighborhood when the group of teenagers chased him while making homophobic remarks and carrying what investigators believed were a stick, a pipe and a cane, the authorities said.

The group caught up with Mr. Collao on 90th Street, between 88th and 89th Avenues, where they punched, kicked and struck him, prosecutors said. The group also took his Atlanta Braves cap and his sneakers.

Mr. Collao died from his injuries two days later.
