Fossilized ring-shaped cakes resembling doughnuts have been unearthed in Native American settlements dating back 8,000 years.

That makes doughnuts something of a national treasure as we celebrate National Doughnut Day.

In modern times, some credit for the doughnut goes to Anna Joralemon, who started selling Dutch “olykoek” (oil cake) in 1673 from a shop in New Amsterdam, today’s Manhattan.

More than 200 years later, free doughnuts were handed to the huddled masses arriving at Ellis Island, as they were later to the hungry during the Great Depression.

During World War I, Salvation Army volunteers used helmets as deep fryers and made holes in the dough with spent artillery shells to deliver doughnuts to American soldiers on the battlefield. They used this basic recipe.

In World War II, women in the Red Cross, known as Doughnut Dollies, did the same to ensure that the treat was available.

Today, Krispy Kreme is giving out free doughnuts. So is Dunkin’ Donuts, with the purchase of a drink, and many local doughnut shops are also taking part.
