Late goals from Antoine Griezmann and Dimitri Payet helped host France earn a 2-0 win over Albania in Marseille on Wednesday and become the first team to advance to the knockout stage of the European Championships.

For the second consecutive match, late pressure rescued a patchy France side that is struggling to live up to its pretournament billing as one of the favorites.

In Friday’s game against Romania, it was Payet’s superb strike from distance that proved decisive, and this time — with the clock running down — Griezmann placed himself in perfect position to nod in a cross from Adil Rami.

France’s president, François Hollande, jumped out of his seat and thrust his arms in the air, and the Stade Velodrome crowd rose as one to hail Payet after another outstanding finish.

With grace and poise reminiscent of the great French player Zinedine Zidane, Payet cut in from the left and beat two players before curling in the second goal. (AP)
