Gov. Doug Ducey on Wednesday signed into law a bill asserting Arizona’s ownership over a herd of horses that roams the banks of the Salt River in the Tonto National Forest northeast of Phoenix. The bill also criminalized the unauthorized killing of the horses, which Mr. Ducey described in a statement as “beautiful, majestic and a treasure to our state.” The horses came under threat last year when federal officials announced their imminent capture, in part because of the risk of accident they could pose to drivers and passengers who go tubing in the river, a popular summer attraction. The new law also creates a private-public partnership to manage the herd, estimated at about 100 horses. FERNANDA SANTOS

A judge upheld an order on Wednesday that the teenager who used an “affluenza” defense in a fatal drunken-driving wreck spend nearly two years in jail. Judge Wayne Salvant, who issued the order last month, had ordered the defendant, Ethan Couch, to spend 180 days in jail for each of the four people he killed in 2013 when he rammed a pickup truck into a crowd of people helping a motorist. The sentences were to be served consecutively. Mr. Couch had argued that the judge’s order exceeded the court’s authority. His case was transferred from juvenile court shortly after he turned 19.

Four journalists arrested during protests that followed the 2014 fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson have settled their lawsuit against the St. Louis County police, lawyers for both sides said Wednesday. Details of the settlement were confidential, but a joint statement said that the county would adopt policy changes to address issues raised in the lawsuit. Filed in March 2015, it accused the county police and 20 officers of violating the reporters’ civil rights and unjustifiably detaining them during the protests that occurred in the days after Mr. Brown, who was black, was shot by a white Ferguson police officer, on Aug. 9, 2014.
