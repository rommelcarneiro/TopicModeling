I generally disdain flavored spirits. But I like this stylish Italian gin that borrows from limoncello and shines with tart, sunny lemon. Gin, after all, depends on added flavoring, including, sometimes, citrus peels. This one, from a family company that has been making gin in the Piedmont region of Italy for 40 years, infuses the alcohol with lemon peels pressed and added to the mix of juniper and other botanicals. Itâ€™s delightful on the rocks, with tonic, in a Negroni or instead of vodka in a slushy sgroppino whisked with lemon sorbet and prosecco: Malfy Gin, $33.99 at Columbus Ave. Wines & Spirits, 730 Columbus Avenue (96th Street), 212-865-7070, columbuswines.com.
