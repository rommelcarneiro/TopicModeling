You’ll see Rome through the eyes and taste buds of Katie Parla and Kristina Gill in this attractive new cookbook. They lightly sketch Roman history via its neighborhoods and their culinary specialties, like offal in Testaccio, Jewish foods from the ghetto and the cooking of Libyan immigrants. Along the way, they describe old recipes that have gone out of fashion and how chefs innovate based on them. Serious cooks may want to tackle the complex bread and pizza recipes and the art of making guanciale at home; others will prefer the simpler crostini slathered with butter and ribbons of anchovy or classic chicken with tomatoes and peppers. I only wish that they had included a list of all the restaurants they mention, with addresses: “Tasting Rome: Fresh Flavors and Forgotten Recipes From an Ancient City” by Katie Parla and Kristina Gill (Clarkson Potter, $30).
