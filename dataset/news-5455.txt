The Rhinebeck Writers Retreat announced its summer residency recipients on Sunday. Nine musicals were selected out of 95 projects, and their writing teams will have weeklong residencies in Rhinebeck, N.Y.

Among the recipients are Brian Crawley, one of the writers of “Violet,” a 2014 New York Times Critics’ Pick, who will develop “Teddy and Max,” about a ’60s musical duo, with Zoe Sarnak; Daniel Goldstein, a 2016 Kleban Prize recipient, who will work on “Row,” about the first woman and American to row solo across the Atlantic Ocean, with Dawn Landes; and Adam Gwon, who wrote “Ordinary Days” (2009), will develop “The Proxy Marriage” along with Michele Lowe.

Past participants include Duncan Sheik (“Spring Awakening”) and Itamar Moses (“The Fortress of Solitude”). A full list of recipients can be found at rhinebeckwriters.org.
