A “super PAC” supporting Donald J. Trump released a partial list of 27 supporters on Thursday, as officials for the group said they would report on Friday having no debt last month and raising more than $1 million.

The group, Great America PAC, released a list of names that included the former actress and conservative pundit Stacey Dash, the New York radiologist Dr. Robert Lapidus and the petroleum executive James Volker.

The group is one of at least four potential super PACs in the works to support Mr. Trump.

Stanley Hubbard, a businessman who signed up with the group in the last few weeks, said in a statement that it was imperative to continue trying to amass support for Mr. Trump. The supporters’ list was intended to show a broad range of regional support around the country.

“With our expanding list of supporters, we will have the financial resources to help Donald Trump win a billion-dollar campaign,” Mr. Hubbard said. “For the sake of our children and grandchildren, Hillary Clinton must not be allowed to take our nation in a dangerous direction.”

Jesse Benton, a former official for the group who now works on a volunteer basis, said that on Friday its filings with the Federal Election Commission would show $1.66 million raised over all, and no debt. Another recently formed super PAC, the Committee for American Sovereignty, featured donors such as Nick Loeb, a former backer of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey.

Mr. Trump has yet to bless any of the super PACs seeking to back him, and there are at least two other outside groups under discussion. His aides have given conflicting signals as to which one to support.
