LONDON — The Royal Bank of Scotland said on Monday that Frank Dangeard, the former chairman and chief executive of the French media and entertainment technology company formerly known as Thomson, had been appointed to its board of directors.

The bank, based in Edinburgh, said that Mr. Dangeard would join its board as a nonexecutive director immediately.

“Frank will be an excellent addition to the board, and I am pleased that he has agreed to join us,” Howard Davies, the R.B.S. chairman, said in a news release. “He is a former banker and senior company executive who has substantial board level experience across a number of sectors.”

Mr. Dangeard is a director at RPX Corporation and at Symantec Corporation.

He previously served as chairman and chief executive of Thomson, now known as Technicolor, and as deputy chief executive officer of France Telecom. He was also chairman of SG Warburg France.

R.B.S. is in the middle of a large restructuring as it shifts away from being a lender with global ambitions to focus on retail and corporate banking in Britain and Ireland. It announced plans last year to dismantle its global investment bank and to reduce the number of countries in which it operates.
