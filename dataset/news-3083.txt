Wading into the calendar for the Performance Mix Festival can feel like embarking on a convoluted mission. The curator Karen Bernard plays by no rules, other than rounding up an inspired multitude of genres and voices each year. For its 30th birthday, the festival returns to its original Lower East Side home, Abrons Arts Center, with 13 events featuring 40 artists over six days, beginning Monday, June 6.

If there’s any theme, it might be unexpected groupings — and deliriously long titles. The week kicks off with “Like a Nova Star: Three Totally Different Trajectories — Each Exploding Brilliantly Away from the Postmodern Center.” This triple bill includes the feminist acrobats of LAVA, the audience-instigated work of Clarinda Mac Low and Yasuko Yokoshi’s re-envisioning of classical Japanese dance.

Monday also brings “Recess: The Ritual Experience Concept Event Spa Show,” in which Michael Helland offers perception-heightening tonics for the body and mind. And that’s just opening night; experiments in tap, video and improvisatory music await later in the week. (212-598-0400, abronsartscenter.org.)
