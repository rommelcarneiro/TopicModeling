Marco Canora, the chef at Hearth in the East Village, has been interested for years in the oyster rooms and cellars that used to dominate New York in the 1890s and early 1900s.

“They were everywhere,” he said. “They were like the hot-dog stands of New York today. They were really raucous places where people brought their mistresses and threw their shells on the floor. It was like a big party with booze and oysters.”

Mr. Canora liked the sound of that, so he decided to convert Fifty Paces, his wine bar on East 12th Street, into Zadie’s Oyster Room, a boozy temple to the bivalve that will open June 16.

As a nod to the vintage menus that he has come across, he and his crew will serve oysters in a wide range of styles: not just raw, but also pickled, fried, broiled, baked, steamed and poached. “I think cooked oysters in general are something we don’t do much in the Northeast, and I don’t really understand why,” he said. “In the South, cooked oysters are huge.”

To make his rendition of poached oysters, Mr. Canora heats up a pan of heavy cream, butter from grass-fed cows, dry sherry, sherry vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, spring onions and spring garlic from the greenmarket and wild wakame seaweed from the Atlantic.

When that beurre fondue has come to a boil, he takes the pan off the heat and slides in raw oysters with their liquor. “I let the residual heat warm the oysters,” he said. “They plump up and get warm and become really succulent.”

Topped with fresh herbs and sourdough croutons, the dish calls out for bread to be dunked in the buttery sauce after the oysters are finished off. Mr. Canora says the secret weapon in the sauce is the wakame. “Oysters and seaweed, they obviously go really well together,” he said.

Seaweed is intricately woven into the menu at Zadie’s. “I almost called it an oyster and seaweed room,” Mr. Canora said. “I thought that would be cute and cool. I kind of wimped out and didn’t do that.”
