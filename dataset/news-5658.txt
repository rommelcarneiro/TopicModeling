PepsiCo has finally parted ways with an activist investor who once tried to break up the company.

Trian Fund Management, run by the billionaire investor Nelson Peltz, had completely sold out of its nearly $2 billion stake — or slightly more than 1 percent — in the beverages and snacks giant, it disclosed in a filing on Friday.

Both sides come out as winners. Pepsi, led by the chairman and chief executive Indra Nooyi, fended off the investor while embarking on a strategic plan that kept the beverages and snacks giant as one company. Trian walked away with a 50 percent return on Peltz’s investment, which he first took on in 2012.

“Trian believes PepsiCo has addressed many operational issues identified by Trian — management has increased productivity efforts, reduced overhead, increased advertising investment, and delivered consistent earnings growth on a constant currency basis,” Trian said in a statement on Friday. “The market has viewed these developments positively and PepsiCo currently trades at a substantially higher multiple than at the time of Trian’s initial investment in late 2012.”

Pepsi declined to comment on actions by individual shareholders.

In 2013, Mr. Peltz called on Pepsi to merge with Mondelez — another one of Mr. Peltz’s holdings — and spin off its beverage unit. Even without a merger, Mr. Peltz called for separating Pepsi’s beverage business from its snacks operations.

Neither of those deals happened, and in January 2015, Mr. Peltz settled with the company by adding William R. Johnson, the former chief executive of Heinz, to Pepsi’s board. Mr. Johnson will remain a board member at Pepsi, despite Trian exiting its stake.

The news of Mr. Peltz’s exit contributed to a slight decline in Pepsi’s stock price, which slipped 1.8 percent on Friday, to $104.18.
