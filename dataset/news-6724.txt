Good evening. Here’s the latest.

1. Donald Trump, the de facto Republican presidential nominee, has begun reassuring party officials that he will build a solid campaign for the general election and pondering how to add pizazz to the convention in July. But Paul Ryan, the highest-ranking elected Republican, said he was not ready to support Mr. Trump. Europeans grappled with a growing sense that Mr. Trump could upend U.S. foreign policy. And some journalists kicked themselves for being blindsided. “Wrong, wrong, wrong — to the very end, we got it wrong,” our media columnist writes.

2. Mr. Trump’s widely shared social media post linking taco bowls, his “love” for Hispanics and Mexico’s Cinco de Mayo holiday appeared unlikely to win back any of the Hispanic voters his campaign has alienated. (Just F.Y.I., Mr. Trump mistook the source of his “best taco bowl” — it came from the Trump Café, not the Trump Tower Grill.)

3. The vigor of Bernie Sanders’s campaign may shift Democratic political primacy away from the liberal rich back to the working class. With Hillary Clinton firmly ahead in the delegate count, strategists are debating whether she could ever muster Mr. Sanders’s online army of roughly nine million highly effective supporters.

4. “Captain America: Civil War” aims for themes particularly relevant during the election season, like the powers of superrich businessmen and the balance of isolationism and collaborative engagement. Our reviewer calls the latest Marvel installment “reasonably enjoyable,” but says it succeeds more in the vein of “a workplace sitcom” than a grand saga.

5. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, ousted his prime minister, above, in a further step into authoritarianism. Analysts said the prime minister’s prominence in making a deal with Europe over refugees infuriated the president. “Erdogan seeks to eliminate anyone in the party who has any ambitions of authority of their own,” one said.

6. The wildfire raging through part of western Canada spread further, forcing some people to evacuate for a second time. “I really felt like it was the apocalypse,” one said. Oil sands projects and pipeline companies suspended operations and evacuated workers around the threatened town of Fort McMurray, reducing production by about a third.

_____

7. The shooters in a fraction of each year’s 30,000 gun deaths are under the age of 5. In one recent week, four toddlers killed themselves and a 2-year-old fatally shot his mother. Above, a 4-year-old who shot and injured her uncle. Such episodes fuel calls for more gun controls, but a gun rights advocate said, “To base public policy on occasional mishaps would be a grave mistake.”

_____

8. Prince appears to have had a problem with pain pills he started taking years ago, which he hid from friends and associates. But his dependence grew so acute recently that friends reached out to an addiction specialist, who was frantically trying to set up treatment when the singer’s body was found.

_____

9. Should prostitution be legal? The Times Magazine examines the intense debate among aid groups over entrapment versus feminist freedom. “I believe in the empowered sex worker,” an advocate for legalization said. “I was one.” But she also said it was important to recognize that most sex workers aren’t. Above, a dominatrix known as Mistress Matisse.

_____

10. The F.D.A. issued sweeping rules for e-cigarettes, to take effect in 90 days, ending a period for the industry that one official called “the wild, wild West.” The rules ban selling e-cigarettes to anyone under 18 and require producers to disclose manufacturing processes and scientific data. Vape shops that mix their own solutions will be considered producers.

_____

11. Finally, London voted for a mayor to replace the outgoing Boris Johnson, one of the most closely watched races on a day of major British elections. In a field of 12, the two front-runners are Zac Goldsmith, the son of a billionaire, and, above right, Sadiq Khan, the son of Pakistani immigrants. If elected, Mr. Khan would be the first Muslim to hold the post. (Earlier, we misspelled his surname Kahn.) Results are expected Friday.
