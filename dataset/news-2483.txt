MILAN — Silvio Berlusconi, the former prime minister of Italy, is suffering from a severe case of aortic insufficiency and will undergo heart surgery to replace a heart valve next week, his doctor said on Thursday.

The doctor, Alberto Zangrillo, said the 79-year-old billionaire businessman “risked dying,” indicating a condition more severe than had been revealed by friends and relatives since Mr. Berlusconi was admitted to a hospital on Sunday.

Dr. Zangrillo said a team of doctors at the San Raffaele clinic in Milan had run a battery of tests and diagnosed a severe case of aortic insufficiency. The condition involves a leaking of the aortic valve, causing blood flow to reverse.

Mr. Berlusconi, who has used a pacemaker for years, will undergo the four-hour surgery by the middle of next week to substitute the valve, after which he will be in intensive care for one or two days before a period of rehabilitation that will last about a month.

Dr. Zangrillo said that after the rehabilitation, Mr. Berlusconi would be “better than before” from the point of view of vitality.

Mr. Berlusconi is barred from holding public office because of a tax fraud conviction, but he remains the head of the Forza Italia party and has been active in mayoral campaigns.
