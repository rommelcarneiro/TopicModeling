WELLINGTON, New Zealand — After many of New Zealand’s top players retired, moved overseas or turned their focus to sevens after last year’s Rugby World Cup victory, many thought the dominance by the country’s teams in Super Rugby would end.

Richie McCaw had called an end to his prolific career. Daniel Carter relocated to France to play for the club Racing 92. Sonny Bill Williams suited up for the All Black Sevens, intent on winning Olympic gold this summer.

But it has been far from a decline this season for New Zealand’s five Super Rugby franchises — the Blues (Auckland), Chiefs (Hamilton), Crusaders (Christchurch), Highlanders (Dunedin) and Hurricanes (Wellington). Heading into the final round of games before a hiatus for June’s international tests, New Zealand teams occupy four of the eight playoff spots. This, even though the New Zealand conference is the most competitive of all.

Under the new system, the winners of the Australia, New Zealand, South Africa 1 and South Africa 2 conferences all qualify for the playoffs and get home-field advantage for the quarterfinals. Three of the wild card spots go to the next best three teams in Australia or New Zealand, and the other goes to one from the South African group.

It means that a few New Zealand teams could finish with more points than conference winners in South Africa or Australia but would still have to play on the road in the playoffs — an important factor, considering they would have to travel 7,000 miles to get to South Africa.

With four rounds to go — three will be played after the June international window — the Chiefs lead the competition with 42 points, while the Crusaders (41), Highlanders (37) and Hurricanes (36) occupy the Australasian Group wild card spots.

The Waratahs (30 points) lead the Australia conference, while the Lions (37) and the Bulls (32) lead their South African conferences, with the Sharks (35) as the wild card.

The dominance of the New Zealand teams is highlighted by their success against the other conferences. In 19 matches between New Zealand and Australian teams, the New Zealanders have won 16, lost 2 and had 1 draw.

In 18 matches between New Zealand and the South Africa 2 teams, New Zealand teams have won 14 and lost 4, while the Australian teams have won 10 and lost 5 against South Africa 1 foes.

New Zealand teams are envied for their ability to promote young talent year after year, without a drop in their standard of play, and 2016 has been no exception. Flyhalf Richie Mo’unga, who had the unenviable task of stepping into Carter’s shoes at the Crusaders, has earned plaudits for his assuredness and creativity in the key playmaking role. Utility back Damian McKenzie is earning rave reviews at the Chiefs for his thrilling attacking play, while the Highlanders’ versatile loose forward Luke Whitelock has impressed his coach, Jamie Joseph, so much that he believes the player has done enough to earn a recall to the national team, the All Blacks.

Even the inconsistent Hurricanes and New Zealand’s worst-performing team, the Blues, have mixed the bad with moments of brilliance.

New Zealand’s derby matches are producing physical, high-intensity and smooth-flowing play that has been a cut above what the other teams are showcasing on a regular basis.

The up-and-down performance of the Australian teams does not worry Michael Cheika, the coach of the Australian national team, as he prepares for a three-test series against England, the Six Nations champion.

“I know that we’re not the best- performing conference in Super Rugby. But I don’t think that we ever claimed we were the best-performing conference in Super Rugby,” Cheika said. “Maybe we’re not top in the conferences, but I know once we decide what’s necessary to be at our best for those games against England, the lads will go for it.”

The Waratahs have one fewer win but more try-scoring bonus points than the Brumbies, whose attack has faltered after a promising start. The race for the Australian conference crown will most likely come down to these two teams, although the loser will need to win most, if not all, of their remaining games to dislodge one of the New Zealand teams from a wild-card spot.

The South African conferences have the greatest disparity, with the Bulls, Stormers, Lions and Sharks a class above the Cheetahs and the competition’s newest teams, the Jaguares of Argentine, the Sunwolves of Japan and the Southern Kings of South Africa.

Of those, the Jaguares have been the most disappointing. Their demanding travel schedule is clearly taking its toll on the expansion franchise, but two wins in 11 matches is not a good return for a roster stacked with international players.

The Sunwolves and Kings have struggled after a chaotic buildup to the start of the season.

The Japanese team is showing some ability on attack and could have added to its lone victory against the Jaguares with better decision-making in tight matches. It drew with the Stormers and lost several other games by just a handful of points, but it also suffered a 92-17 thumping at the hands of the Cheetahs.

The hapless Kings have just four competition points and have suffered some heavy defeats, including a 73-27 loss against the Jaguares, and have scored 190 while giving up a competition-worst 505 points for a point differential of minus 315. The next closest team is the Sunwolves, at minus 170.
