It took six days for Rajiv Surendra, a calligraphy artist, to create chalk trompe l’oeil panels on the walls of Garrow Kedigian’s “Napoleon’s Lounge.” But it would take only a moment to undo.

That notion of impermanence delighted Mr. Kedigian, who hoped that visitors to the Kips Bay Decorator Show House, which opens Thursday, would feel free to reach out and touch the elaborate walls, whatever the consequences. “It’s about something that is fleeting,” he said. “Kips Bay is only here for a minute. We’re only here for a moment.”

As temporary as it is, the show house, with the work of 21 design firms spread out over five floors of a new limestone-clad townhouse on East 61st Street, is a ripe and riotous corrective to the muscular blandness — hello, Restoration Hardware — that has overwhelmed so many contemporary interiors.

In the silver and gold dining room by Alex Papachristidis, Claude Lalanne chairs have an alligator skin crust, and a gold luster-glazed hand-thrown gourd by Christopher Spitzmiller is as big as a puppy. Victoria Hagan sewed LED lights into billowing white curtains. In their salon, Brian Sawyer and John Berson plucked a pair of martyred saints by Andrea Vaccaro from their gilded frames and set them on a brass panel, perhaps the house’s best decorating tip.

Jamie Drake was thinking of “a mute button for the senses,” he said, when he wrapped the walls of the bedroom he designed with Caleb Anderson in a shimmering silver fabric. “I agree with Arianna Huffington,” Mr. Drake said, referring to the media mogul’s new book on sleep deprivation. “We’re all so inundated all the time. We need a place to turn everything off. “

The ultimate luxury, he suggested, is not a $49.5 million townhouse like this one, it’s a good night’s sleep.

The Kips Bay Decorator Show House is open through June 9 at 19 East 61st Street; $35, 212-755-5733, kipsbaydecoratorshowhouse.org.
