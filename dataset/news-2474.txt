A Bronx man was sentenced on Thursday to 25 years in prison for fatally stabbing his friend after an argument and then throwing her body off the roof of her apartment building, prosecutors said.

The man, Duvale Stevens, pleaded guilty in April in State Supreme Court in the Bronx to first-degree manslaughter of the friend, Andrea Hurd, who was blind, prosecutors said.

In the early morning hours of March 27, 2013, the authorities said, Mr. Stevens, 38, was socializing with Ms. Hurd, 49, at her apartment in the Melrose neighborhood. The two of them got into an argument, the authorities said, and he grabbed a kitchen knife and began stabbing her. In all, prosecutors said, he stabbed her 28 times.

The authorities said Mr. Stevens carried her body to the roof of her six-story apartment building and hurled it over the side. Then, prosecutors said, he went back to her apartment and fell asleep in her bed, where the police found him later in the morning.

Mr. Stevensâ€™s lawyer declined to comment.
