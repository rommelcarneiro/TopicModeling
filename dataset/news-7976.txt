A 16-year-old boy has been arrested in Australia on suspicion of plotting to carry out an attack during the country’s veterans commemorations on Monday, the police said.

The boy, whose name was not disclosed by the authorities, was arrested on Sunday in Auburn, a Sydney suburb, after he was said to have tried to obtain a firearm, according to Australian news reports. He was charged with planning a terrorist act, which carries a maximum penalty of life in prison.

The boy’s lawyer said he would contest the charge and apply for bail in a hearing on Tuesday, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported.

The Australian justice minister, Michael Keenan, said in a written statement that the plot was “a truly chilling and disturbing scenario” and “a sad reflection of the current terror threat landscape in Australia.”

Last year, the Australian police arrested several people accused of plotting to attack police officers at a veterans’ parade. A 15-year-old British boy who was described as an organizer in that case was convicted and sentenced to at least five years in prison.

April 25 is Anzac Day in Australia and New Zealand. The national holiday, which commemorates veterans, corresponds with the anniversary of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps’ 1915 landing at the Gallipoli Peninsula in Turkey during World War I.

The New South Wales police commissioner, Andrew Scipione, said the arrest should not affect plans for Anzac Day in Sydney. “We believe at this stage we’ve dealt with this particular threat,” he said on Monday during a news conference. “This was one person by himself.”
