A steep slide in traditional safe-play stocks, like phone companies and utilities, weighed on Wall Street on Thursday, bringing to a close a three-day rally.

The broad decline came as investors pored over company earnings for clues about the trajectory of the economy.

Oil prices also fell, extending losses for the battered energy sector.

“Today might be a little bit of profit-taking after such a big run here,” said Jeff Kravetz, regional investment strategist at U.S. Bank’s Private Client Reserve. “We did have a few companies that reported weaker-than-expected earnings.”

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 113.75 points, or 0.6 percent, to 17,982.52.

More companies are due to post their quarterly results in coming weeks. So far, traders have been quick to make buy or sell depending on whether the companies lived up to the market’s expectations.

“We’re still seeing a lot of companies struggling to meet that top line of revenue, and that’s the bigger story,” said JJ Kinahan, TD Ameritrade’s chief strategist.

Casino operator Las Vegas Sands also failed to match Wall Street’s expectations. That sent the stock down $4.79, or 9.2 percent, to $47.39.
