The Brazil-born Italian striker Éder Citadin Martins overcame an otherwise patchy performance, hitting a late winner in a 1-0 victory over Sweden on Friday in Toulouse, France, that sent Italy into the final 16 of the 2016 European Championships.

Éder, playing in his first major tournament for Italy since becoming a citizen last year, came close to being substituted by Manager Antonio Conte after a dismal opening half up front alongside Southampton striker Graziano Pellè.

“I’m very happy with the goal,” said Éder, who has struggled to make an impact this season at Inter Milan after moving from Sampdoria in January.

“I’m delighted for the team, and I’m very happy the coach has kept faith with me,” he added.

Italy, a 2-0 winner over Belgium last week, now tops Group E with 6 points, leaving Sweden, whose late claims for a penalty were rejected, in need of a victory over Belgium on Wednesday to have any realistic hope of making it to the knockout phase. (AFP)
