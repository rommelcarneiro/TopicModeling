A man who investigators believe was trying to rob a bar in Queens was fatally shot on Monday by a retired New York City officer who was there, the police said.

The police were called just before 4 a.m. to the Parkside Pub, a bar on 149th Street in the Whitestone neighborhood, where they found a 24-year-old man with a gunshot wound to his head, the authorities said. The man, who was identified by the police as Andrew McClean, was pronounced dead at the scene.

The authorities said Mr. McClean, who lived in the neighborhood, about a mile away, had come into the pub with a gun and was trying to rob patrons when one of them, the retired officer, a 69-year-old man, fired a single shot. That shot struck Mr. McClean in the head.

The police said the shooting remained under investigation.
