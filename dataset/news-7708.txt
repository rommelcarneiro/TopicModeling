LONDON — The bidding war for Darty, the French electronics and appliance retailer, appears to be over.

Conforama, the French household goods unit of Steinhoff International Holdings, said on Wednesday that it had no plans to raise its offer for Darty after Groupe Fnac made a final bid for the retailer on Monday.

Fnac and Conforama have been entwined in a frantic battle for Darty, with each offering escalating bids last week.

On Monday, Fnac said it was willing to pay 914 million pounds, or about $1.3 billion, in cash for the London-listed retailer, or 170 pence a share. Fnac also said at the time that it owned or had agreements in place for investors to support its offer, equivalent to 41.05 percent of Darty shares.

That exceeded Conforama’s highest — and apparently now final — offer of 160 pence a share, or about £860 million, in cash.

“Our independent board and management had a clear valuation in mind for the stand-alone Darty business,” Conforama said in a news release on Wednesday.

Conforama said that at a price of 160 pence a share, “the Darty business would have been a good addition to the Steinhoff group of businesses but, at an increased price, it would no longer create sufficient value for Steinhoff shareholders, employees and other stakeholders.”

The fight for Darty began in March, when Steinhoff of South Africa offered to buy the retailer at a price that exceeded the one in a previous merger agreement with Fnac. In November, Fnac had offered to pay £558 million for Darty.

Also in March, Steinhoff abandoned its pursuit of the Home Retail Group as it faced a separate and potentially lengthy battle with J Sainsbury, one of Britain’s largest grocery store chains.

The bidding for Darty heated up last week when a series of escalating offers by Conforama and Fnac on April 21 sent shares of Darty up 23 percent in trading in London.

Darty shares fell less than 1 percent in morning trading in London on Wednesday.

The company operates about 400 stores in Belgium, France and the Netherlands. It reported revenue of more than 3.5 billion euros, or about $3.9 billion, in its 2014-15 fiscal year.
