Stocks rose on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve, as investors expected, left its key interest rate unchanged.

Energy companies climbed again as the price of oil came close to a six-month high, and technology stocks were battered after Apple and Twitter posted weak results.

Stocks opened mostly low in early trading, but they moved higher after the Fed released its decision on interest rates. Bond yields fell, and investors bought high-dividend phone and utility companies instead.

The Nasdaq composite index fell for the fifth day in a row, reflecting losses for tech stocks.

The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 3.45 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,095.15. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 25.14 points, or 0.5 percent, to 4,863.14.

The Dow Jones industrial average picked up 51.23 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,041.55.

Bond prices were rising before the Fed’s announcement and rose even higher after its statement was released. Higher prices mean lower yields, and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.85 percent from 1.93 percent.

Lower bond yields made telecommunications and utility stocks more appealing to investors. Verizon Communications gained $1.25, or 2.5 percent, to $51.69. NRG Energy added 44 cents, or 3.1 percent, to $15.

The price of crude oil started with big gains, turned lower, and then bounced back. It wound up at its highest price since early December. Benchmark United States crude rose $1.29, or 2.9 percent, to close at $45.33 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, added $1.43, or 3.1 percent, to $47.17 a barrel in London.

Among energy stocks, Anadarko Petroleum added $2.42, or 4.6 percent, to $54.78, and Diamond Offshore Drilling gained 98 cents, or 4.1 percent, to $24.63.

Tech stocks fell after Apple said iPhone sales declined in the first quarter. That hadn’t happened since iPhones went on sale in 2007. Apple also reported its first decline in quarterly revenue since 2003 and forecast similar results in the current quarter. Its stock skidded $6.53, or 6.3 percent, to $97.82.

Twitter dropped $2.89, or 16.3 percent, to $14.86 after its first-quarter revenue fell short of expectations. Its stock has fallen 71 percent in the last year.

Earnings reports were responsible for much of the day’s action. The aerospace giant Boeing was the biggest gainer on the Dow average. The company reported mixed first-quarter results, with weaker-than-expected earnings but strong sales. The stock rose $3.82, or 2.9 percent, to $137.06.

The medical device maker Boston Scientific climbed to its highest price in 10 years after it swung to a profit in the first quarter and reported earnings and sales that were better than expected. It also raised its projections for the year. The stock gained $2.20, or 11.2 percent, to $21.89.

Buffalo Wild Wings tumbled $15.62, or 10.8 percent, to $129 after the chain’s sales fell short of analyst projections.

Chipotle Mexican Grill fell $28.79, or 6.5 percent, to $417.01. Chipotle posted its first loss as a public company because of plunging sales after an E. coli outbreak and norovirus scare.

The tax preparer H&R Block slumped $3.23, or 13.6 percent, to $20.59 after the company said it handled fewer returns this year than it did in 2015 and announced a series of executive changes.

DreamWorks Animation rocketed $5.08, or 18.7 percent, to $32.20 on reports the company behind the “Shrek” and “Kung Fu Panda” franchises might be acquired by Comcast. Comcast stock rose 2 cents, to $61.30.

Yahoo will add four directors backed by the activist investment firm Starboard Value to its board. That ends a potential proxy fight between Yahoo and Starboard. Yahoo stock lost 16 cents, to $36.95.
