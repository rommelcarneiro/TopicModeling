I love these large, flat green beans, often called Romano beans or runner beans and popular in Europe. They may show up at some farm stands and Greenmarket purveyors later in summer but now, thanks to a California-based grower who harvests them in Mexico, they’re available more regularly. Cook them a good 10 minutes for meaty tenderness; crunchy is not the goal. Serve them whole, doused with vinaigrette; fry them dripping tempura batter; cut them up to add to salads; or slap them on the grill: Mann’s Tenderbite Beans, $3.99 a pound at Eataly, Agata & Valentina stores and Grace’s Marketplace stores.
