On Monday, help us document the first day of summer by sharing your photos of New York City.

We want you to share photos of your morning run or your first summer sunset â€” and the events in between. We are not looking for summery selfies; we want to see your view of the world around you, from dawn to dusk.

Please post your photos on Instagram with the hashtag #NYTsummerday. Make sure to include the time and the location in your caption. We plan to publish a selection of photos on nytimes.com, in print and on social media. If we decide to publish your picture, we will follow up to ask you a few questions.

If you are not on Instagram, you can email your photo to cityroom@nytimes.com.

Please note: The picture you post must be one that you took yourself on June 20, 2016, in New York City.

The deadline to submit is Monday at 11:59 p.m.
