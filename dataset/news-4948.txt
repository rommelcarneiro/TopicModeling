Nearly a year after Josef Helfenstein announced that he would step down as director of the Menil Collection in Houston, the museum has found his successor at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Rebecca Rabinow, the Met’s curator of Modern art and curator-in-charge of the Leonard A. Lauder Research Center for Modern Art, on Thursday was named the Menil’s new director, where she will start in July.

Raised in Houston, Dr. Rabinow worked as an intern at the Menil after graduating from college. “It shaped my vision for what a museum could be,” she said in a telephone interview, adding that her approach would be “looking back to see what the vision originally was and how to move it into the 21st century.”

Janet Hobby, the Menil’s president, said, “Rebecca stood out for her expertise and curatorial stature.”

Dr. Rabinow was educated at Smith College, the Sorbonne and New York University’s Institute of Fine Arts.

Since joining the Met in 1990, Dr. Rabinow has organized several noteworthy exhibitions — including shows on Cubism and Matisse — and was an organizer of the 2007 renovation and reinstallation of the Met’s galleries of 19th- and early-20th-Century European painting and sculpture.
