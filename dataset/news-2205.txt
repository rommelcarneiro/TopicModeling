When Vincent Canby reviewed the 1989 John Hughes movie “Uncle Buck” for The New York Times, he called the premise a “good sitcom idea.” Nearly three decades later, that assessment is being put to the test by ABC, with a sitcom based on the film that starts Tuesday, June 14. But there’s a big difference: The title character, played by John Candy in the film, is now black, as is the rest of the central family in the show. Mike Epps portrays Buck, a ne’er-do-well who is pressed into service as a weekend babysitter by his brother and sister-in-law (James Lesure and Nia Long).

Before the weekend is over, their three children have had their education furthered at a bar and an unsupervised party, and Uncle Buck has discovered his inner nanny. Uncle Buck may look different in this incarnation, but — as in the movie — he’s still vexed by a backfiring car, and he still makes giant pancakes for breakfast.
