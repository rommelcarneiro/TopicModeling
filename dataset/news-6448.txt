Kenneth Branagh initially found portraying Kurt Wallander, the addled Swedish detective, so intensely disconcerting that he wore bright clothes and attended flower shows to cheer himself up. “I learned there was a journey in and through and away from all the dark materials that these books contain,” he said in a phone interview from London about the Henning Mankell novels on which “Wallander” is based. “Kurt felt these things very keenly, and lived and breathed through these crimes, and it wasn’t always terribly healthy for me.”

“Wallander: The Final Season,” starting Sunday, May 8, on PBS, was no less daunting as Kurt confronts Alzheimer’s. “I found myself watching a bit at a distance because it was frankly a scary place to go,” Mr. Branagh said, recalling the time when Mr. Mankell, who died in October, revealed to him that he had written his character’s last words. “I saw him kind of wave goodbye to Kurt on the page,” he added, “and I found myself waving goodbye to him on the screen.”
