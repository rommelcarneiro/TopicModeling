Great Plains Energy, the parent company of Kansas City Power and Light Company, said on Tuesday that it had agreed to acquire Westar Energy for $8.6 billion in cash and stock.

The transaction would create an energy provider with more than 1.5 million customers in Kansas and Missouri.

Under the terms of the deal, Great Plains Energy would pay $60 a share in cash and stock for Westar, representing a 13 percent premium on Westar’s closing price on Friday.

Including the assumption of debt, the transaction values Westar at $12.2 billion.

“The combination of our two companies is the best fit for meeting our region’s energy needs,” Terry Bassham, the Great Plains Energy chairman and chief executive, said in a news release. “By combining our two companies, we are keeping ownership local and management responsive to regulators, customers and regional needs, while enhancing our ability to build long-term value for shareholders.”

The deal has been unanimously approved by the boards of both companies and is subject to approval by shareholders and regulators. The transaction is expected to close in spring 2017.

Under the terms of the deal, Westar investors would receive $51 in cash and the equivalent of about $9 in Great Plains Energy stock for each share of Westar.

Westar would become a subsidiary of Great Plains Energy if the deal is completed, and Mr. Bassham would be chairman and chief executive of the combined company.

“This is an important day for Westar, our customers, employees, shareholders, the communities we support and for the state of Kansas,” Mark A. Ruelle, the Westar president and chief executive, said.

The companies already jointly own and operate the Wolf Creek Generating Station, a nuclear power plant near Burlington, Kan., and the La Cygne and Jeffrey power plants in Kansas.

Goldman Sachs and the law firm Bracewell advised Great Plains Energy. Guggenheim Securities and the law firm Baker Botts advised Westar Energy.
