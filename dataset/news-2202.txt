SEOUL, South Korea — The ACT college entrance exam was canceled on Saturday for thousands of students in South Korea and Hong Kong, after the test’s administrator said it had verified a breach of the testing materials.

The last-minute cancellation affected 5,500 students at 56 test centers in South Korea and Hong Kong, said Edward R. Colby, a spokesman for ACT. Students’ registration fees will be refunded, he said in an email.

“ACT received credible evidence of the breach on Friday, June 10, and made the decision to cancel the test centers soon after,” he said. “This is the first known cancellation of an ACT test administration in an entire country.”

News of the cancellation reached many students only hours before they were scheduled to take the test on Saturday morning. “Hotel expense, transportation fee, this is totally a disaster,” one frustrated Chinese student in Hong Kong wrote on Twitter.

Overseas applications for the ACT and SAT exams are on the rise as more foreign students seek admission to American colleges. As more students take the tests, cheating on the exams has also become widespread in parts of Asia.

In 2013, the College Board, which administers the SAT, canceled its test in South Korea after exam questions were leaked. It also canceled tests in China and Macau in January for the same reason. This month, a South Korean court fined students and officials of test-prep institutes up to 6 million won, or about $5,100, for selling stolen SAT test materials on the internet between 2011 and 2013.
