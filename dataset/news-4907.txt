An oil pipeline company responsible for a vast spill in the Pacific Ocean last year did not do enough to prevent corrosion and its operators did not detect and react to the spill quickly enough, federal regulators said Thursday. The company, Plains All American Pipeline, also did not have adequate systems to signal there was a major leak in the pipeline running near the Santa Barbara County coast, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration said in its final report. The report was issued on the anniversary of the 120,000 gallon spill and two days after the company was indicted on dozens of criminal charges, including four felony counts of polluting state waters and three dozen misdemeanor charges of harming wildlife. Beaches along the scenic coast were closed for weeks as an oil plume spread nine miles into the ocean. Houston-based Plains has apologized and said it was an accident that does not merit criminal charges. (AP)

The owners of an Aurora theater where 12 people were killed during a screening of a Batman film are not liable for the shooting, a jury ruled Thursday in the first lawsuit stemming from the 2012 massacre. Jurors ruled in favor of Cinemark USA in the lawsuit filed by more than two dozen surviving victims and relatives of the dead. James Holmes, who pleaded innocent by reason of insanity at his murder trial, was found guilty of killing 12 people and wounding 70. He was sentenced to life in prison. (REUTERS)

J. Dennis Hastert, the former House speaker, was ordered Thursday to report to prison by June 22 to serve a 15-month sentence in his hush-money case. A prisons spokesman said the name of the prison would not be disclosed until Mr. Hastert, 74, reported. He pleaded guilty to violating banking laws while seeking to pay $3.5 million to someone he molested when he coached high school wrestling. (AP)
