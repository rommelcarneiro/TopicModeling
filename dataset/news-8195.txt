Forty years have passed since the Utah Symphony last visited Carnegie Hall. This concert celebrates a comeback in more than one way: After sustaining an artistic slump and financial difficulties in the intervening decades, the orchestra can take pride in how it has blossomed under its new music director, Thierry Fischer — just in time for the current 75th anniversary season. An ambitious overhaul of personnel and programming is bearing fruit, as evidenced by an excellent new recording of commissioned works by Nico Muhly, Augusta Read Thomas and Andrew Norman.

The Carnegie Hall concert represents the New York premiere of Mr. Norman’s percussion concerto “Switch,” a zany, high-energy work that the soloist, Colin Currie, has likened to being trapped in a pinball machine. Also on the program are works by Prokofiev and Bartok, and Haydn’s Symphony No. 96 — a deliberate choice, surely, given its nickname: “The Miracle.” (8 p.m., Friday, April 29, Stern Auditorium, carnegiehall.org.)
