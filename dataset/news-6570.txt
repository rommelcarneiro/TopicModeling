LONDON — Moneta Money Bank, the banking business of GE Capital in the Czech Republic, said on Friday that it was valued at 34.7 billion Czech korunas, or about $1.5 billion, in its initial public offering in Prague.

The stock offering for the business, formerly known as GE Money Bank, continues efforts by General Electric to retreat from finance and focus on its industrial roots.

General Electric said last year that it planned to sell the bulk of GE Capital within two years. Since then, GE Capital has entered into agreements for asset sales worth more than $170 billion.

The Czech business priced its offering of 260.6 million shares on the Prague Stock Exchange at 68 korunas a share, the bottom of its expected price range.

GE Capital sold 51 percent of Moneta’s shares and will retain a minority stake in the Czech bank.

Shares of Moneta were up slightly at 68.05 korunas around midday on Friday, as conditional trading began in Prague.

“This I.P.O. is another milestone in the execution of G.E.’s strategy to significantly reduce its financial services businesses,” Richard Laxer, the president and chief executive of GE Capital International, said in a news release.

Plans to pursue an initial public offering for the Czech business were announced in April.

The bank, based in Prague, has 229 branches and 629 A.T.M.s in the Czech Republic. It serves 1.17 million retail and commercial customers in the country. The company posted a profit of 4.5 billion korunas in 2015.

Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase served as joint global coordinators on the offering.
