Miguel Cabrera hit two home runs, Jordan Zimmermann’s streak of scoreless innings ended after center fielder Tyler Collins appeared to direct an obscene gesture at fans, and the host Detroit Tigers defeated the Oakland Athletics, 7-3, on Monday night.

Zimmermann gave up a run for the first time with the Tigers after 24⅓ scoreless innings, and Collins seemed to take the brunt of the blame from fans.

Collins responded by making the obscene gesture and appeared to yell an obscenity as he reacted to the booing crowd.

He seemed to lose a fly ball hit by Oakland’s Marcus Semien in the lights, and an error charged to left fielder Justin Upton allowed Semien to reach third base. Semien scored after Billy Burns hit a single to end Zimmermann’s unblemished start.

“To be at home and to hear boos after that play hit a trigger inside of me, and I lashed out completely inappropriately,” Collins said.

RAYS 2, ORIOLES 0 Chris Archer struck out 10 over six and two-thirds innings to end a 10-start winless streak, and Tampa Bay beat Kevin Gausman and Baltimore in St. Petersburg, Fla.

Archer allowed five hits to get his first win since defeating the Orioles last August.

TWINS 4, INDIANS 3 Oswaldo Arcia led off the ninth inning with a home run off Zach McAllister, and Minnesota edged visiting Cleveland.

Brian Dozier added a two-run double for the Twins.

WHITE SOX 7, BLUE JAYS 5 Todd Frazier doubled home the go-ahead run in a five-run seventh inning, and Chicago won in Toronto.

Frazier went 2 for 3 with three R.B.I.

RED SOX 1, BRAVES 0 Rick Porcello combined with three relievers on a four-hitter, Jackie Bradley Jr. hit his first home run of the season, and visiting Boston handed Atlanta its sixth straight loss.

Porcello won his fourth straight start, allowing only four hits with two walks.
