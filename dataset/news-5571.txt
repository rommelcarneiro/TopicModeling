A spacious penthouse at 150 Charles Street, the Witkoff Group’s new brick-and-glass condominium in the West Village, which sold out weeks after sales began, has officially closed for $29,379,796.41, according to city records, and was the most expensive sale of the week.

The sponsor apartment, PHA, with monthly charges of $6,948, has five bedrooms and five and a half baths over 4,553 square feet. There is also 2,521 square feet of outdoor space, which provides stunning cityscape and Hudson River views, including the Statue of Liberty.

The new owner has access to amenities in the 91-unit building, including private green space, a 75-foot lap pool, a fitness center, a lounge and a children’s playroom.

The buyer’s identity was shielded by the limited liability company 150 Charles Street PH A. Raphael De Niro, Darren Sukenik, Madeline Hult Elghanayan and Peter Zaitzeff of Douglas Elliman Real Estate were the listing brokers. They represented both sides of the transaction.

Also this past week, two more apartments have closed at the newly completed 432 Park Avenue, the tallest residential tower in the Western Hemisphere, topping out at 1,396 feet.

The pricier of these sponsor units was No. 70B, which is about three-quarters of the way up the 96-story, glass-and-concrete condominium between 56th and 57th Streets. It sold for $28,146,836.66, according to city records, and has monthly carrying costs of $15,986.

The 4,019-square-foot apartment, which offers panoramic views of Central Park, the Hudson River and the downtown skyline, contains three bedrooms, three and a half baths and a library. The buyer was identified as Ensof Park LLC.

All sales in the building are being handled by Macklowe Properties Sales and Douglas Elliman Development Marketing.

The other sponsor unit, 43A, which was slightly larger and also has park and skyline views, sold for $21,06,740.45, property records show.

The apartment has 4,430 square feet that includes four bedrooms, four and a half baths and a library. The buyer’s identity was shielded by the limited liability company Andover Acquisitions.

Both apartments at 432 Park have private elevator landings, 12.6-foot ceilings and 10-by-10-foot square windows.
