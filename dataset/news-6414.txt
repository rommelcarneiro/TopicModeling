May 4: The Women’s Committee of Central Park Conservancy hosted the 34th annual luncheon in the garden at 105th Street. It would be wrong to assume that hats are back in fashion — guests at the luncheon wore headdresses to celebrate spring. This was one of the rare instances when guests were forced to use the umbrellas that are customarily handed out at the end of the luncheon, above. Though the trees and flowers were in full bloom, the clothes provided the color. This was the first year some guests wore fur. Among the footwear were daintier versions of gardening shoes.
