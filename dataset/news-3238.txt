Congratulations: You settled on a look. It’s been a long time coming, from the thrift-shop bowling shirts of your college days, through the failed sartorial experiments of your late-night years. Now that you’ve calmed down a little, you have a pair of slightly expensive European jeans, a few pairs of pants that could be called slacks, 12 button-down shirts with unfrayed collars and four blazers from medium-level designers found on a discount site a year after they left the department store. You feel all right with the look, on the whole. You’re presentable. Nobody stares. But deep down, you know you resemble a magazine photographer from 1981.
