HARRISON, N.J. â€” Bradley Wright-Phillips recorded the fastest hat trick in M.L.S. history as the Red Bulls beat Toronto F.C., 3-0.

Wright-Phillips, who scored in the fourth, 25th and 27th minutes, has eight goals in the last seven games after going scoreless in the first seven. It was his first hat trick since 2014, when he had three.

He opened the scoring with a header, later froze a defender and went near post, and finished with a goal from the corner of the 6-yard box. Sacha Kljestan recorded two assists and leads M.L.S. with 10.

The Red Bulls played a man down for the entire second half after Gonzalo Veron received a red card in the 43rd minute.

The Red Bulls (6-7-1), who had an M.L.S.-low 3 points on April 24, moved into a tie for second place in the Eastern Conference.
