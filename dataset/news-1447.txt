A Dolly Parton concert can be a rapid-fire event in which she appears not entirely trusting of your patience or the depth of your interest in her as one of country music’s greatest singers and songwriters. But last fall in Nashville, she played a few benefit concerts at the Ryman Auditorium billed as “Pure and Simple,” performing with only four musicians onstage.

No surprise that it was received well: If you like her musicality, the strength in her voice and conviction in her songs, you want that and not the moat around it. (When she played at Radio City Music Hall in 2008, her band was twice that size, not counting the backup singers.)

Now comes what is billed as her first major North American tour in more than 25 years, with the same scaled-down concept and a record also called “Pure and Simple,” made up of new songs and greatest hits, due in August. She heads to Forest Hills Stadium in Queens on Saturday, June 25, and PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel, N.J., on June 26. (foresthillsstadium.com; banksartscentre.com.)
