To create a series of bar carts, USM Modular Furniture tapped the expertise of three New York mixologists: Ivy Mix of Leyenda, Jane Danger of Mother of Pearl, and St. John Frizell of Fort Defiance. Using the companyâ€™s colorful modular Haller shelving, each has come up with a rolling bar cart that can be used indoors or out. For hers, Ms. Danger included a shelf to hold a record player. The height of each cart varies according to the designer. None include a built-in cutting board, something I would want, but the people at USM say it can be added. The carts are worth considering for a very special dad, graduate or newlyweds: Limited Edition Bar Carts, $3,778 to $5,466 at USM Modular, 28 Greene Street (Grand Street), 212-371-1230, usm.com.
