Lin-Manuel Miranda, the creator and star of the Broadway musical “Hamilton,” on Sunday night took his concern about Puerto Rico’s financial crisis to television, performing a rapped plea for relief on “Last Week Tonight With John Oliver.”

Mr. Miranda, whose parents are both from Puerto Rico, has been deploying his newfound celebrity to urge Congress to assist the island. Last month, while in Washington to visit the White House, he spoke at a news conference and met with members of Congress and he also wrote an op-ed piece on the issue for The New York Times.

In his appearance on the HBO show, at which he was accompanied by Alex Lacamoire, the “Hamilton” music director, Mr. Miranda outlined his concern for Puerto Rico and again asked Congress to do more. He joked, referring to the speaker of the House, “Paul Ryan, I’ll come sing ‘Hamilton’ at your house.”

Here is the video of the “John Oliver” segment on Puerto Rico – Mr. Miranda’s appearance begins at 19 minutes.
