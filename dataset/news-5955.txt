A few years ago Annette and Herbert Kopp, the creative couple behind the bold, architectural bijoux of the German atelier CADA, decided to infuse their affinity for contemporary art into a new project.

Mr. Kopp, inspired by the couple’s own art collection, determined that the initial pieces for CADA Goes Art would be created by the American conceptual sculptor Aaron Curry and two German artists, Jonathan Meese (“who loves gold,” Mr. Kopp said) and Andy Hope, who previously had made plastic jewelry.

Mr. Curry’s pieces, five years in the making and the last to be released, recently were displayed at the Almine Rech Gallery in Paris and now are available exclusively on CADA’s website.

The artist’s characteristic whimsy came to life in 18 pieces — Bull, Cactus and Moon styles — created in pink, yellow and white gold, black rhodium, diamonds, citrines, corals, amethysts, rubies and sapphires. Prices range from 19,800 euros to 129,000 euros, or $22,400 to $145,800.

The geometric creations resemble Mr. Curry’s colorful, abstract sculptures but the artist said the designs emerged from shapes he kept repeating; he didn’t just shrink his larger creations.

“I doodled a lot. I first thought big pendants and earrings,” he said. “Herbert looked at the sketches and said, ‘Wow, that would rip a woman’s ear off.’ I hadn’t gotten my head around material and scale.”

So why did Mr. Curry agree to participate in the project?

“Aaron did it,” Mr. Kopp said with a smile, “because he gets the jewelry for his wife.”
