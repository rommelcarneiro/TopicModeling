Théodore Rousseau (1812-1867) ranks high on the list of underappreciated 19th-century European painters. A mystic who thought trees spoke to him, and a materialist prone to unorthodox mixtures of media on canvas, panel and paper, he was a leader of the Barbizon school, yet his name is far less familiar than those of Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot or Jean-François Millet. Not interested in the human figure, Rousseau attended to nature’s textures and moods, zeroing in on details of leaves and bark, while using light and weather to render nature as a source of terror and contemplation.

His heady combination of Romanticism and Realism — which helped lay the groundwork for Impressionism — was very popular with American collectors in the late 19th century. Even so, “Unruly Nature: The Landscapes of Théodore Rousseau,” which opens Tuesday, June 21, at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, is the first thorough review of his restless career, especially the way he sometimes made painting and drawing all but merge. (getty.edu.)
