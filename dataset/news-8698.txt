I have to love a cookbook that starts with recipes for mayonnaise. And Alexandra Raij and her husband, Eder Montero, go well beyond mayonnaise to explain Basque cuisine. (He is the Basque side of the equation.) Txangurro, the deviled crab meat gratin that is served everywhere in the region but is often disappointing, was a winner here, despite the demanding preparation of a couple of ingredients. (You can work around them.) There was nothing demanding, though, about the excellent rice studded with cockles, the butterflied trout slipcovered in ham and given a splash of garlic and parsley oil, and the springtime lamb meatballs tucked among peas. For dessert, the notion of marinating fresh pineapple in sherry is a keeper: “The Basque Book” Alexandra Raij with Eder Montero and Rebecca Flint Marx (Ten Speed Press, $29.99).
