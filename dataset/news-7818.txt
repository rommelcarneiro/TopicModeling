Stocks finished mostly higher on Tuesday in another cautious day of trading. Energy companies climbed in tandem with the price of oil, but technology companies fell.

The market wavered between small gains and losses throughout the day. Chemical companies made the biggest gains, led by DuPont. Health care stocks fell on more regulatory scrutiny of drug pricing. The Nasdaq composite index dropped for the fourth day in a row.

Trading has been light this week. Julian Emanuel, United States equities and derivatives strategist for UBS, said investors were waiting to see the results of Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan policy meetings in the next few days.

“People are very, very wary of taking big positions,” he said. “The commentary is going to be very closely parsed.”

The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 3.91 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,091.70. The Nasdaq fell 7.50 points, or 0.2 percent, to 4,888.28.

The Dow Jones industrial average added 13.08 points, or 0.1 percent, at 17,990.32.

The price of benchmark United States crude oil jumped $1.40, or 3.3 percent, to $44.04 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained $1.26, or 2.8 percent, to $45.74 a barrel in London.

That helped energy stocks, and ConocoPhillips rose $1.81, or 3.9 percent, to $48.08, while Pioneer Natural Resources gained $11.86, or 7.7 percent, to $165.36. The oil company BP rose $1.70, or 5.4 percent, to $33.49 after it posted a larger-than-expected profit and left its dividend unchanged even though oil prices and energy income have plunged.

Chemical companies and makers of mining and construction equipment reported solid quarterly results. Mr. Emanuel of UBS said that energy, chemical and mining companies and heavy machinery makers were getting a hand from China’s economy, which is doing better than investors expected a few months ago.

DuPont, the chemicals giant, picked up $1.58, or 2.4 percent, to $67.55. The company expects a larger profit for the year, and says the strong dollar won’t hurt its results as much as it had predicted. Dow Chemical, which is preparing to combine with DuPont, added $1.13, or 2.2 percent, to $53.67.

The truck leasing company Ryder System added $4.20, or 6.4 percent, to $69.45. The manufacturing company Ingersoll-Rand rose $1.36, or 2.1 percent, to $65.39. The truck maker Paccar gained $2.88, or 5.1 percent, to $58.93.

Elsewhere, the specialty glass maker Corning lost $1.75, or 8.4 percent, to $19.22 after its sales were weaker than expected. Whirlpool, the appliance maker behind Maytag, KitchenAid and other brands, reported disappointing profit and sales. The company said its business was hurt by the strong dollar. The stock lost $6.60, or 3.6 percent, to $179.43.

The drug developer Sarepta Therapeutics plunged after a Food and Drug Administration panel said its muscular dystrophy drug eteplirsen should not be approved. The panelists said evidence did not show the drug to be effective. The stock fell $3.93, or 26.3 percent, to $11.02.

In Britain, the FTSE 100 rose 0.4 percent, while the DAX in Germany and the CAC 40 in France each lost 0.3 percent. The Nikkei 225 in Japan fell 0.5 percent and the South Korean Kospi rose 0.3 percent. The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong gained 0.5 percent.
