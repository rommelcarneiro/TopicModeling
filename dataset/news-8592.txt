Europe for Memorial Day?

In a bid to attract travelers still considering getaway options for the late-May holiday, hotels around the Continent are offering attractive packages. These deals tied to the fast-approaching three-day weekend are part of a growing trend of last-minute European vacations, according to Misty Belles, the director of global public relations for the luxury travel network Virtuoso.

“Our research shows that travelers are planning in advance when it comes to far-flung places such as Asia but are increasingly looking at Europe as an opportunity to partake in spur-of-the moment quick trips,” she said. “Hotels are catching on to this and creating incentives to get people to book.”
