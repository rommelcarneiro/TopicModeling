The 229th time I scraped the bottom of our Volkswagen over a tope — Mexico’s brand of speed bump — I swore as though I’d just been rear-ended by a truck.

There was no sign to warn of the giant mound of pavement, which meant that I hit the thing at full-on launch velocity. And its size practically guaranteed damage: In my rearview mirror, I could see deep lines scraped by my car’s chassis and many others before me.

Must have just been poorly fashioned, you say? A mistake? If only.

There are thousands, maybe millions, of these misshapen risers on back roads and highways all over Mexico. The biggest of the bunch look like Fernando Botero sculptures before he slimmed them down.

When I arrived in Mexico as a New York Times correspondent, I thought the topes were just infrequent oddities. But over time, layers of meaning emerged, as they do with so many things in Mexico.

Topes (pronounced TOE-pace) are suspension-killing wonders that fill a void in law and order. In a country where impunity rules, topes are screams of frustration. They’re a means of enforcing speed control and civility on the road, and they can’t be avoided. They can’t be bribed to look the other way.

But topes also reflect the same failures that they aim to fix. There appear to be few rules governing what they look like or where they go. I’ve seen makeshift topes materialize in upper-class neighborhoods from one day to the next, and I’ve seen topes that were built, I’m convinced, just to make drivers slow down for vendors who sell candy and water.

Other topes seem to have been created more with vengeance in mind, which now makes me wonder: Was someone after a corrupt gang member or businessman who sped by every morning? Or was the target really me — a foreigner from that country up north that never seems to give Mexico the respect it deserves?
