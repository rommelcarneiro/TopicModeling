The Dow Jones industrial average fell 8.01 points, or 0.05 percent, to 17,492.93.

Several members of the Federal Reserve will be making speeches this week, which may give insight on what Fed policy makers might do at their meeting in June. Minutes from the Fed’s late April meeting showed that the nation’s central bank seems to believe the U.S. economy has improved enough to warrant higher interest rates.

“Very quiet today,” Ryan Larson, head of U.S. equity trading at RBC Global Asset Management, wrote in response to an email query from The Associated Press. “The hesitation seems to directly related to what the Fed may or may not do come its June meeting.”

On Monday, interest rates on three-month bills hit their highest level in more than seven years.

The three-month rate was the highest since Nov. 10, 2008, at the height of the financial crisis. The six-month rate was the highest since March 14.

The yield on the 10-year note fell to 1.83 percent from 1.84 percent.
