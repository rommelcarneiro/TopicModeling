INTERNATIONAL

A headline on Saturday with an article about a summit meeting and state dinner in Washington referred incorrectly, in some editions, to four of the five Nordic leaders who attended. The Swedish, Icelandic, Norwegian and Danish prime ministers are heads of government, not heads of state. (Only the Finnish president is a head of state.)

•

An article on April 19 about Indonesia’s decision to rule out a criminal investigation of mass atrocities committed half a century ago during anti-Communist purges misquoted Joshua Oppenheimer, an American film director who has produced two documentaries about the period. He said a failure to truthfully account for the atrocities of 1965-66 would deny people “any sort of closure,” not “any source of closure.”

An article on March 23 about a Greenpeace report warning that China’s consumption of coal is worsening a severe water shortage in the northern part of the country misstated the amount of fresh water consumed annually by the world’s coal-fired power plants when coal extraction and washing are taken into account, according to the report. It is 23 billion cubic meters, not 23 million. In addition, the article, using information from Greenpeace East Asia, misstated the total installed capacity of China’s coal-fired power plants. It is 804 gigawatts, not 358 gigawatts. The errors were corrected online shortly after the article was published, but editors failed to follow through with this print correction.

•

Because of an editing error, the Budapest Journal article on March 10, about efforts by the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orban, to change the face of Budapest with two huge building projects, referred incorrectly to the Museum of Fine Arts on Heroes’ Square. Romanesque Hall, which is to be restored under the government’s plan, is part of the museum, not the square. The error was corrected online shortly after the article was published, but editors failed to follow through with this print correction.

NATIONAL

An article last Tuesday about President Obama’s signing a bill to make the bison the national mammal referred incorrectly in some editions to the birth of mammals. They can in fact be birthed through eggs.

BUSINESS DAY

An article on Saturday about myths involving the United States economy and the increasing size of its older population misstated the frequency of 65th birthday anniversaries among baby boomers. It is 8,000 a day, not 8,000 a month.

•

Because of an editing error, an article on Sunday about changes underway at Capitol Hill newspapers misstated the surname of the new publisher of The Hill. She is Johanna Derlega, not Derlerga.

•

A correction in this space on Saturday about a byline that was omitted for an automobile review misspelled the name of the car being reviewed. As the review and its headline had correctly noted, it is the 2016 Chevrolet Camaro, not Camero.

Weekend

A music review on Friday about the ensemble Yarn/Wire, at Miller Theater at Columbia University, misstated the surname of one of the group’s pianists at one point. As the review correctly noted elsewhere, the pianist, Ning Yu, is Ms. Yu, not Ms. Ying.

•

Dance entries in the Listings pages on Friday and on May 6 about American Ballet Theater, at the Metropolitan Opera House, misspelled the surname of the composer of the score for “Sylvia,” which the company performed. He was Léo Delibes, not Delibe.

OBITUARIES

An obituary on Saturday about Martin Friedman, the longtime director of the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, omitted part of the name of the center’s founder. He was Thomas Barlow Walker, not Thomas Barlow. And an accompanying picture caption misidentified the painter of “Trio,” a work with which Mr. Friedman was shown. He was Adolph Gottlieb, not Adrian Gottlieb.

•

An obituary on Thursday about John Young, the founder of the organization Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities, erroneously included one major league team among those he worked for as a scout. He did not work for the Baltimore Orioles.
