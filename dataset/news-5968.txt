European antitrust officials on Wednesday rebuffed renewed efforts to consolidate the region’s telecommunications sector, blocking a proposed $14.5 billion deal between two major British carriers.

Under the proposed deal, Hutchison Whampoa, one of the Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing’s flagship companies, which owns the British operator Three, had sought to acquire O2, a rival in Britain owned by the Spanish telecom giant Telefónica.

But Europe’s competition chief, Margrethe Vestager, said the deal would limit consumer choice and could raise prices in Britain. “We want the mobile telecoms sector to be competitive, so that consumers can enjoy innovative mobile services at fair prices and high network quality,” Ms. Vestager said in a statement on Wednesday.

Ms. Vestager’s tough stance comes as the Danish politician has taken a muscular approach to defending Europe’s competition rules, including charging Google for abusing its market position with some of its online search products and with its use of Android, its smartphone operating system.

The European Commission has also accused Gazprom, the Russian energy giant, of antitrust practices in the natural gas markets. Google and Gazprom deny any wrongdoing.

Three’s failed takeover of O2, an antitrust decision widely expected by many in Europe’s flagging telecom industry, comes amid growing uncertainty in the sector after a series of other deals among the region’s more than 100 local carriers fell through.

Those include an attempt by Orange, France’s former monopoly, to buy Bouygues Telecom, a local rival, for more than $11 billion. That bid failed after the two sides said last month that they could not agree to terms. Last year, the carriers Telenor and TeliaSonera also called off talks to combine their Danish operations after failing to win European antitrust approval.

Many of the region’s policy makers remain skeptical over such deals, concerned that multibillion-dollar takeovers could lead to increased cellphone-plan prices just as people become increasingly reliant on their mobile devices. On average, Europeans pay roughly half as much for their monthly cellphone contracts as Americans do, according to the GSMA, an industry group.

But many in the telecom industry have urged greater consolidation, claiming that fewer players in each of the European Union’s 28 member states could help drive increased spending on high-speed mobile networks and other infrastructure needed to keep pace with the United States and Asia.

“The collapse of the deal leaves both Three and O2 in a precarious position with uncertain futures in the U.K.,” said Kester Mann, a London-based analyst with the research company CCS Insight. “It also casts serious doubt over the future structure of a European telecoms sector that had banked on the tie-up paving the way to further consolidation.”

Europe’s mounting hesitation to approve telecom deals also contrasts with the United States, where companies like Comcast and Verizon Communications, among others, are extending their reach beyond their traditional business into new markets. Last month, Comcast bought DreamWorks Animation, a movie studio, for $3.8 billion.

Such deals, however, remain mostly out of bounds in Europe, where lawmakers have prioritized consumer choice, including access to at least four telecom operators in many countries, over consolidation.

As part of its decision on Wednesday, the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, said the takeover would have “removed an important competitor.” It added that “reduced competition” would probably have led to higher prices and lower quality on mobile services.

Telefónica and Hutchison Whampoa had offered concessions, including allowing access to their networks to competitors, in an effort to win approval for the deal.

Hutchison Whampoa said in a statement that it was “deeply disappointed” by the commission’s decision, and that it would consider a legal challenge.

The decision to block the merger has already prompted other telecom and cable operators to circle O2. Companies that appear interested in picking up the British carrier include Liberty Global, the cable operator controlled by the American billionaire John C. Malone; and Iliad, a French carrier.

In a conference call with analysts last week, José María Álvarez-Pallete López, Telefónica’s executive chairman, said that, regardless of the commission’s decision, his company had a “very comfortable” cash position that meant it would not need to rush into deciding what to do with O2.
