“Waitress,” the new musical featuring songs by Sara Bareilles, grossed more than $1 million last week, passing a symbolic Broadway milepost for the first time.

The box-office success suggests that “Waitress” is destined to become a hit, joining “Hamilton” and “School of Rock” from the last season. Two other new musicals, “Shuffle Along, or the Making of the Musical Sensation of 1921 and All That Followed,” and “On Your Feet!,” have also performed strongly since they opened.

The box-office report for the week ending May 29, released Tuesday by the Broadway League, also shows that “Paramour,” the musical-plus-acrobatics mash-up that is Cirque du Soleil’s first Broadway venture, is off to an impressive start, despite negative reviews.

“Paramour” grossed $1.1 million last week, even after giving away tickets for two press performances and for opening night on Wednesday.

Overall, despite an influx of tourists over Memorial Day weekend, the grosses last week were flat. The 37 shows running took in $28.7 million, compared with $28.8 million grossed by 36 shows the previous week. Most had a drop in their grosses.

The short-lived musical “Tuck Everlasting” closed Sunday; it grossed $410,516 in its final week, up $85,155 over the previous week, as theatergoers seized a final chance to see it.
