A fired police officer was charged Wednesday in the killing of a legally armed black musician who had apparently thrown his weapon and was running away when he was shot, prosecutors and court documents said. The former officer, Nouman Raja, was arrested and charged with attempted murder and manslaughter in the Oct. 18 death of Corey Jones, 31, after a grand jury found the shooting was unjustified, Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg said. Mr. Jones’s sport utility vehicle had broken down on a highway ramp. He had gotten out and was on the phone with roadside assistance when Mr. Raja, who is of South Asian descent, pulled up in an unmarked van. The men’s exchange was captured on the call center recording. “At no time during the recording did Raja say he was a police officer,” the affidavit said. “Instead, Raja replied by asking the single word ‘Really?’ when Jones twice said, ‘I’m good.’ ” Both men apparently pulled guns. Mr. Raja, 38, fired six shots, hitting Mr. Jones three times. Mr. Jones never fired. (AP)

A jury has awarded $22 million to a man who says he was beaten by an East Cleveland police detective, locked in a storage closet with no toilet for four days and given nothing to eat or drink except a carton of milk. The Cleveland jury found in favor of the man, Arnold Black, 48, of East Cleveland, in a civil trial. Relatives testified that Mr. Black had to have surgery to remove dried blood on his brain. The trial was held without lawyers representing East Cleveland. City Law Director Willa Hemmons, when contacted Wednesday, said she was not aware that a trial had been held. It is unclear how cash-strapped East Cleveland could pay anything as officials there consider filing the state’s first-ever municipal bankruptcy and explore a merger with neighboring Cleveland.
