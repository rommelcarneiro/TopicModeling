Croatia came from behind to beat Spain, the two-time defending champion, by 2-1 on Tuesday in Bordeaux, France, and finish atop Group D at the European Championships.

An 87th-minute goal by Ivan Perisic ended an unbeaten run by Spain at the championships that stretched to 2004.

Spain will meet Italy in the round of 16, at Stade de France in St.-Denis on Monday — a repeat of the 2012 final, which Spain won by 4-0. Croatia will play a third-place team in the northern French city Lens on Saturday.

Striker Álvaro Morata put Spain ahead in the seventh minute, redirecting the ball into the net after a shot by midfielder Cesc Fàbregas.

After Perisic delivered a cross from the left, Nikola Kalinic tied the score just before halftime with a back-heel flick that beat Spain goalkeeper David de Gea at the near post.

Spain had a chance to retake the lead, but Sergio Ramos had a penalty kick saved by Croatia goalkeeper Danijel Subasic in the 72nd minute.

It proved to be a costly miss as Perisic finished off a fast counterattack with a low left-footed shot that beat de Gea at his near post.
