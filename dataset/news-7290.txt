In a 2010 piece called “Make Ryan a Dancer,” the multidisciplinary artist Ryan McNamara submitted himself, over a period of months under public scrutiny, to the invigorating but daunting task of learning to dance. It must have been a good experience, because movement remains a serious muse. A few years later, his “Meem: A Story Ballet About the Internet” was a hit on the art festival circuit, and this week the Guggenheim Museum’s Works & Process series presents his “Battleground,” which the institution commissioned. Mr. McNamara impishly calls the work a “Cosplay-Battle-Ballet,” referring to the performance art of costume play often associated with anime and manga. With sci-fi and fantasy in mind, he turns the museum’s intimate Peter B. Lewis Theater into the titular battleground, dividing it into three war zones, and musters nine dancers to serve in competing armies. The audience sits in the line of fire. True to the series’ chatty nature, Mr. McNamara will discuss the genesis of the work as well. (Monday, May 2, through Wednesday, May 4, at 7:30 p.m., 212-423-3587; guggenheim.org.)
