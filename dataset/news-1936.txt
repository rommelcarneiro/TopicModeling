La Brea Bakery has started using heirloom wheat called fortuna in three new breads it has brought together as La Brea Bakery Reserve. The breads are struan, made with some emmer and spelt and dusted with sesame seeds; pain de campagne, with a crisp crust and great complexity from rye; and fortuna, somewhat denser and riddled with cracked wheat berries. Dean Folkvord, head of Wheat Montana, the grower near Big Sky, said the grain is cultivated on a high plateau from tall stalks, making it more difficult to harvest: La Brea Bakery Reserve, $8 to $10, amazonfresh.com.
