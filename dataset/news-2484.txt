BAGHDAD — Two suicide attacks in and around the Iraqi capital on Thursday killed at least 31 people and wounded dozens, officials said.

The deadliest attack took place in a commercial area of a majority Shiite neighborhood in Baghdad. At least 19 civilians were killed and 46 wounded, the police said.

Another suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden car into an Iraqi Army checkpoint in the town of Taji, north of the capital, killing at least 12 and wounding 32, a police officer said. The attack killed seven civilians and five soldiers, the officer said.

In an online statement, the Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack in the capital, in the New Baghdad neighborhood, saying it had targeted Shiite militia members. The group later claimed responsibility for the bombing in Taji, about 12 miles north of Baghdad, in a second online statement, saying it was targeting the Iraqi Army.

The authenticity of the statements could not immediately be verified, but they were posted on a militant website commonly used by the extremists.

The Islamic State, a Sunni group, often targets Iraq’s Shiite majority, its security forces and government officials. Baghdad has seen near-daily attacks in recent weeks.

The deadly attacks in the capital area are seen by Iraqi officials as an attempt by the militants to distract the security forces’ attention from the front lines. The attacks came a day after Iraqi special forces pushed into the city of Falluja, held by the Islamic State, in a large-scale military operation started last month.

Falluja, about 40 miles west of Baghdad, is one of the last major Islamic State strongholds in western Iraq. The extremist group still controls territory in the country’s north and west, as well as Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city.
