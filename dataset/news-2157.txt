Olivia Magowan, a daughter of Nina Magowan and Mark E. Magowan of New York, was married June 11 to Dr. Nicholas John Shea, the son of Dr. Katherine G. Nickerson and Dr. Steven J. C. Shea of Dobbs Ferry, N.Y. Felice K. Shea, a retired New York State Supreme Court justice and the groom’s paternal grandmother, officiated at the home of the bride’s parents.

Ms. Magowan, 31, is keeping her name. Until last month, she was the associate fashion director at Bloomingdale’s in New York. She graduated from Harvard.

Her parents are the managing partners and the publishers of the Vendome Press, an art and illustrated-book publishing house in New York. The bride is a great-granddaughter of the late Charles E. Merrill, a founder of Merrill Lynch.

Dr. Shea, 29, received a medical degree from Columbia last month. In July, he will begin a cardiothoracic-surgery internship at NewYork-Presbyterian Columbia hospital. He graduated cum laude from Columbia, from which he also received a master’s in biomedical engineering.

The groom’s parents are members of the faculty at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York. His mother, a rheumatologist, is a professor of medicine and the vice chairman for education in its department of medicine. His father, an internist and epidemiologist, is the senior vice dean and the Hamilton Southworth Professor of Medicine and Professor of Epidemiology.

The couple met through mutual friends in New York in January 2015.
