Good evening. Here’s the latest.

1. An intense, international search mission found airplane debris, suitcases and human remains in the Mediterranean from the crash of EgyptAir Flight 804. The cause of the crash remains a mystery and the subject of intense speculation.

_____

2. The White House and the Treasury Department were put on lockdown after the Secret Service shot a man nearby. An investigation is underway. President Obama was away at the time, playing golf at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. We’ll have updates here.

_____

3. The National Rifle Association made a relatively late endorsement of Donald Trump’s candidacy, and he in turn tried to win over remaining skeptics of his commitment to gun rights. He told the N.R.A.’s annual meeting in Louisville, Ky., that he would do away with gun-free zones at schools, and said, “Crooked Hillary Clinton is the most anti-gun, anti-Second Amendment candidate ever to run for office.”

_____

4. Prosecutors released a video showing a fatal confrontation involving two Georgia sheriff’s deputies and a handcuffed, hallucinating man. The disturbing video, taken by the officers’ body cameras as they repeatedly shocked the man with their Tasers, is the latest to capture a death involving the police.

_____

5. Taiwan inaugurated its first female president. Tsai Ing-wen spoke cautiously about the mainland, navigating between her party’s commitment to Taiwanese autonomy and China’s focus on ever-closer ties. Her call for the two nations to “set aside the baggage of history, and engage in positive dialogue” was immediately criticized by China’s Taiwan Affairs Office.

6. May is usually pretty hot in India, but one desert city saw a record high of 123.8 degrees Fahrenheit. A doctor said it was like “heat waves were coming out of a clay oven.” Severe heat is forecast across central and northern India into next week. Above, escaping the heat in New Delhi.

_____

7. Palestinians living on the edge of border towns in Gaza are increasingly anxious as Hamas rebuilds tunnels for attacks, inviting Israeli military strikes. “Dear God — we will be torn apart,” one woman said, adding, “I am sure, one million percent, that those with tunnels under their houses cannot sleep, or taste the joy of life.”

_____

8. The Times helped descendants of 272 slaves Georgetown University sold to stay afloat in 1838 piece together their families’ histories. Some of them say it is time for Georgetown to do at least two things. First, formally acknowledge their families. Second, offer free educations to every descendant of those slaves. “Our families are still here,” one said.

9. Couch time this weekend? You could tune in to HBO to see Bryan Cranston as L.B.J. in the movie adaptation of his Tony-winning role in “All the Way” (Saturday, 8 p.m. Eastern). Here’s our review. And “Preacher,” adapted from a comic-book series, offers what our critic calls “a metaphysical action caper, stylized and splattery.” It debuts Sunday on AMC (10 p.m. Eastern). We have more recommendations here.

_____

10. The glass and masonry fortresses of New York are the focus of our best-read story today. Whether pencil skyscrapers or squat apartment blocks, the buildings are shaped by the same invisible force: the U.S.’s first city zoning code. The current code, after a century of evolution, would not have approved 40 percent of the city’s standing edifices.

_____

11. Finally, counting your calories should get a little easier. Coming food labels put calorie counts in large type and carry more realistic portion sizes (like two-thirds of a cup for ice cream, rather than half a cup). Federal rules require major food makers to use them by July 2018. “This has to be scored as a huge win,” said the nutrition expert Marion Nestle.
