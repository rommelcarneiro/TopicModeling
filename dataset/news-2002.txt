The brokerage industry’s overseer, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, on Monday named a former markets regulator, Robert W. Cook, as its president and chief executive officer.

Mr. Cook had been a partner in the Washington offices of the law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton since 2013. Before that, he was director of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s division of trading and markets, where he oversaw the staff’s review and analysis of the “flash crash” in May 2010. He also oversaw the carrying out of new rules for Wall Street arising from the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial regulation overhaul and the 2012 JOBS Act. He had been at Cleary Gottlieb for 18 years before joining the S.E.C. in 2010.

Finra is splitting the roles of chairman and chief executive now that Richard Ketchum is scheduled to retire later this year. Mr. Ketchum has held both titles since 2009, and he announced last fall his intention to retire in the second half of 2016. The regulator said in a statement on Monday that its board, which is led by the former Vanguard Group chief, Jack Brennan, would name a new chairman in the coming months.

As a lawyer at Cleary Gottlieb, Mr. Cook focused on the regulation of the securities markets as well as broker-dealers, exchanges, alternative trading systems and clearing firms.

He will join Finra as the agency is in the middle of a review of cultural values in the brokerage industry, asking more than a dozen brokerage firms earlier this year to answer questions about their own practices, including how executives identify rogue employees whose actions contradict company policy.

Finra said the appointment would take effect in the second half of 2016.
