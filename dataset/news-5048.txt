The Metropolitan Opera is not the only major American company in the market for a new music director. The San Francisco Opera announced Wednesday that its music director, Nicola Luisotti, would step down when his contract is up at the end of the 2017-18 season.

The announcement means that the company will soon be under new artistic leadership as well as new administrative leadership. Its general director, David Gockley, is stepping down at the end of the current season and will be succeeded by Matthew Shilvock.

Mr. Luisotti, 55, who was born in Tuscany, was appointed by Mr. Gockley and assumed the San Francisco post in 2009, succeeding Donald Runnicles. He said in a statement that he wanted Mr. Shilvock “to be able to move freely into the future with his ideas, his artistic interests and to take San Francisco Opera into a new direction.”

“As hard as it is for me to say this about a company I so dearly love, I sincerely believe this is the right path and the right time for me and San Francisco Opera,” he said in the statement, in which he said he would “look to new opportunities.”

His departure leaves two of America’s leading opera companies looking to sign new music directors. At the Metropolitan Opera, James Levine, who shaped the modern company and made its orchestra world class, retired this month, 40 years after he became its music director. One widely discussed candidate to succeed him is Yannick Nézet-Séguin, the music director of the Philadelphia Orchestra, but no announcements have been made.

Mr. Shilvock, who will become general director of the San Francisco Opera in August, said in a statement that choosing a new music director would be one of his chief tasks.

“I will start looking immediately,” he said, “but will take the time necessary to find the right partner.”
