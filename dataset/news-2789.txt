A survey of the personalities who make New York’s food scene tick are collected in this compelling volume by a writer whose beat is not food. What she offers are first-person accounts from more than 50 individuals behind city institutions like Zabar’s and Peter Luger. You will find Justo Thomas, the fish butcher at Le Bernardin; Jeb Burke, the head chef at Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation; and Nino Esposito, an owner of Sette Mezzo. And there are plenty of opinions to savor, like Mr. Esposito’s point that “New Yorkers like to see and be seen by people they know”: “Food and the City” by Ina Yalof (G. P. Putnam’s Sons, $28).
