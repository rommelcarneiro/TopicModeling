United States stocks barely budged on Thursday as investors moved cautiously after two days of large gains.

Utilities and phone companies rose the most because of a decline in bond yields. Chemical companies and banks surrendered some of their recent gains.

Stocks alternated between small losses and gains, and moved more on individual news than broad trends. The retailers Dollar Tree and Costco rose after they reported strong quarterly results. That made them exceptions in a difficult quarter for department stores, watch sellers and clothing companies.

Stocks nudged up after Jerome Powell, who sits on the Federal Reserve’s committee that determines interest rates, suggested that the Fed would wait a little longer before it raised rates again.

“That reduces the risk of an unpleasant surprise at the June meeting,” said Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist for Northern Trust.

The chairwoman of the Fed, Janet L. Yellen, will speak at Harvard University on Friday, and Mr. McDonald said investors did not want to make big moves before they hear her views.

The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index lost 0.44 point, to close at 2,090.10. The Nasdaq composite index added 6.88 points, or 0.1 percent, to 4,901.77. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 23.22 points, or 0.1 percent, to 17,828.29.

Bond yields, which have risen over the last few weeks, dropped as prices rose. That sent utility and phone company stocks higher because those stocks are seen as similar to bonds, and the lower yields make them more appealing compared with bonds.

NextEra Energy rose $1.59, or 1.3 percent, to close at $119.82, and Con Edison rose 91 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $72.73. AT&T added 21 cents, to $38.83.

The yield on the 10-year United States Treasury note fell to 1.83 percent from 1.87 percent.

Chemical companies, which posted some of the biggest gains on Wednesday, traded lower. Monsanto, which has jumped after talks about a potential sale to Bayer, lost $2.01, or 1.8 percent, to $109.62. DuPont fell $1.27, or 1.9 percent, to $66.96. Citigroup led banks lower, losing 83 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $46.11.

Weak earnings reports have weighed on retailers’ stocks in recent weeks. Among other problems, shoppers are not spending as much on clothes and the strong dollar is hurting profits and sales overseas. But on Thursday, several retailers disclosed solid results from the last three months.

Dollar Tree said its first-quarter profit more than tripled, and it raised its expectations for the year. Its stock gained $10.01, or 12.8 percent, to $88.37. Also jumping after a strong report was PVH, the owner of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands, which added $3.90, or 4.3 percent, to $93.73. And the wholesale club operator Costco rose $5.17, or 3.6 percent, to $149.71.

Like the broader market, oil prices were little changed. United States crude slipped 8 cents to $49.48 a barrel in New York, and Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, fell 15 cents to $49.59 a barrel in London. Oil prices are at their highest level since October, but United States crude has not closed above $50 a barrel since July.

Stocks have risen to some of their highest levels of 2016, driven by investors encouraged by strong monthly home sales in the United States and economic support for Greece. But similar news on Thursday, including a drop in new applications for unemployment benefits and further growth in pending home sales, did not make much of a difference to Wall Street. And a government report showed that a measurement of business investment fell for the third month in a row, which suggested that manufacturing was still under pressure.

The jewelry company Signet Jewelers slumped after it posted weaker-than-expected sales and lowered its projections for sales at older stores. The stock lost $11.49, or 10.6 percent, to $96.88.

HP, the maker of personal computers and printers, reported a bigger profit than predicted, giving it a solid outlook for the year. The stock climbed 84 cents, or 6.8 percent, to $13.04.

U.S. Foods Holding, the second-biggest food service distributor in the country, went public with a $1.02 billion initial public offering. It was one of the largest I.P.O.s of the year, as the market turmoil over the last few months has made companies hesitant to go public. The stock jumped $1.91, or 8.3 percent, to $24.91.

In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline fell 2 cents to settle at $1.62 a gallon. Heating oil declined 1 cent to $1.50 a gallon. Natural gas fell 3 cents to $1.96 per 1,000 cubic feet.

The price of gold slipped for the seventh day in a row, losing $3.40, to $1,220.40 an ounce. Silver rose 8 cents to $16.34 an ounce. Copper was unchanged at $2.10 a pound.

The CAC in France and the DAX in Germany both gained 0.7 percent, and the FTSE in Britain was little changed. The Nikkei 225 index in Japan added nearly 0.1 percent. The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong added 0.1 percent.

The dollar slipped to 109.72 yen from 110.14 yen. The euro inched up to $1.1186 from $1.1151.
