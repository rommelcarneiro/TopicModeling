Here are the week’s top stories, and a look ahead.

1. A gunman killed 50 people and wounded 53 in an attack at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla., early Sunday morning, making it the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. The gunman was dead at the scene and was identified as Omar Mateen, an American citizen, the police said. Law enforcement officials said Mr. Mateen had pledged his allegiance to ISIS. Here is a timeline of the attack, according to officials. Check back for more updates as we follow this story.

2. Hillary Clinton reveled in her status as the first woman to claim a major party’s presidential nomination after winning four more primaries, including delegate-rich California. She embraced President Obama’s endorsement, was bolstered by Senator Elizabeth Warren and escalated clashes with Donald Trump. Bernie Sanders promised to work with Mrs. Clinton to defeat Mr. Trump, but kept campaigning.

3. Mr. Trump continued to disrupt his party, saying the Republican convention should feature sports stars and “winners” rather than politicians. A Times special report reveals that even as Mr. Trump’s Atlantic City casinos failed, he made millions — and others paid the price.

4. Court documents and almost daily revelations fed the furor over “rape culture” on college campuses after a California judge sentenced a former Stanford University swimmer to just six months on three felony counts of sexual assault. Denunciations of the light sentence and widespread support for the victim — even from Vice President Joe Biden and the House floor — suggest that the cultural attitude toward rape may be shifting.

5. A final tribute for Muhammad Ali: In his hometown of Louisville, Ky., celebrities and dignitaries honored and eulogized the champion, whose fame transcended sport. His widow delivered his special message to young people: “It is far more difficult to sacrifice oneself in the name of peace than to take up arms in the name of violence.” The sports world lost another iconic figure: Gordie Howe, 88, the longtime Detroit Red Wings player known as Mr. Hockey.

6. Will “Hamilton” make more history tonight? The blockbuster Broadway production is up for a record 16 Tony Awards (8 p.m. Eastern, CBS), and our reporting suggests it may walk away with 12, tying the high mark set by “The Producers” 15 years ago. It’s already a financial winner, generating $600,000 a week in profit, a sum set to grow as touring companies start up. Its creator and soon-to-depart star, Lin-Manuel Miranda, is expected to make about $6.4 million a year.

7. Extremists across Central and Eastern Europe are feeding fears about the influx of migrants to bolster their agendas. Some are encouraging vigilante groups to patrol borders, trains and public streets, even in areas where few migrants pass. Above, a photo released in April by a group known as the Organization for the Protection of Bulgarian Citizens, which shows them in an encounter with Afghan migrants.

8. In sports, the Pittsburgh Penguins will try to crush the surprisingly resilient San Jose Sharks for the Stanley Cup (8 p.m. Eastern, NBC, CBC, TVA). The N.B.A. finals head into Game 5 on Monday, with the Golden State Warriors leading the Cleveland Cavaliers, 3-1 (9 p.m. Eastern, ABC). Lydia Ko, above, is aiming for her third straight major golf title in the final rounds at the KPMG Women’s P.G.A. Championship (4:30 p.m. Eastern, NBC; 6 p.m. Eastern, Golf Channel). And you can follow both the European soccer championships and the Copa América Centenario here.

(Earlier, we incorrectly called the golf tournament the KMPG Women’s P.G.A. Championship.)

9. The powerful leader of the New York City correction officers’ union, Norman Seabrook, was arrested on corruption charges. The shake-up imperils broad reforms intended to end violence and graft at the Rikers jail complex. The case could have wide-ranging consequences for Mayor Bill de Blasio. One of the informants is a central figure in one of a half-dozen investigations focused on the mayor’s campaign fund-raising.

10. Post-traumatic stress disorder may not be only an emotional or cognitive problem. A study of brain injuries among military personnel found evidence of tissue damage caused by blasts. A former Iraq correspondent says that if further research bolsters the findings, one conclusion may be inescapable: Modern warfare destroys the brain.

11. Top computer scientists, alarmed by the revelations of Edward Snowden, opened discussions this week to try to figure out how to keep the web from evolving further into an arm of Big Brother or Big Business. The web’s creator, Tim Berners-Lee, cited factors like “spying, blocking sites, repurposing people’s content, taking you to the wrong websites” that he said undermined “the spirit of helping people create.”

12. Ramadan, the holiest month of the Muslim calendar, has begun. Able-bodied women and men will fast from sunrise to sunset for a month. And this fall, when millions of Muslims make the annual hajj to Mecca, the spiritual heart of Islam, pilgrims will find a city at the peak of almost 40 years of radical modernization.

13. Finally, are you still using periods in your text messages? Probably not, unless you’re trying to convey being annoyed or upset. “The period now has an emotional charge and has become an emoticon of sorts,” said David Crystal, who has written more than 100 books on language. On that note, have a great week
