Maille, the French mustard company with a boutique on the Upper West Side since late 2014, now has a bigger showcase. Like the first store, it’s outfitted with taps for dispensing mustard in various flavors, but here there is also vinegar on tap (Sauternes at first) in a black refillable bottle. This flagship store has a mustard tasting bar, and an area for classes about mustard that will start next month, including the opportunity to concoct a custom blend ($59) with an array of ingredients under the tutelage of the company’s mustard “sommelier,” Pierette Huttner: 927 Broadway (21st Street), 929-335-6610, maille.com.
