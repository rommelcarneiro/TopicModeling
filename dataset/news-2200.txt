As downtown theaters start their summer vacations, take it as a sign: It’s time to go outside. Beginning on Thursday, June 16, the River to River Festival, gracing the nooks and crannies of Lower Manhattan as well as Governors Island, hosts some of the city’s most rewarding dance offerings. And they’re free.

Eiko Otake, who presents an installation of video material and uses her seeming fragility to explore trauma and loneliness, appears in the flesh in “A Body on Governors Island” (Sunday, June 19) and “A Body on Wall Street” (June 21 and 22). The excellent hip-hop dancer and choreographer Ephrat Asherie collaborates with Ehud Asherie, her jazz pianist-composer brother, in “Riff This, Riff That” (June 20 and 21) to illuminate the musicality between jazz and hip-hop. And Luciana Achugar closes the festival with “An Epilogue for Otro Teatro: True Love” (June 26), in which she breaks down the barrier between audience and performer to create a “communion ritual,” in which the audience — she hopes — will be moved from apathy to empathy.
