Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings, who played Celebrate Brooklyn! in 2010 and released a holiday soul album last year, will kick off the BRIC Celebrate Brooklyn! Festival in Prospect Park on June 8. Gregory Porter, Bombino and Dr. Dog will also perform free concerts at the 38th annual event, which runs through Aug. 13 in the park’s bandshell.

Jon Batiste and Stay Human will take a break from backing Stephen Colbert at “The Late Show” to perform on July 23. This year’s lineup includes a strong international showing. The rock band Alvvays (Canada) plays on June 23; Angélique Kidjo (Benin) pays tribute to Celia Cruz with the percussionist Pedrito Martinez (Cuba) on July 29; and Bombino (Niger) and Femi Kuti (Nigeria) perform a double bill on July 22.

On Aug. 6, Paola Prestini’s “The Hubble Cantata” will receive its world premiere, featuring the Norwegian orchestra 1B1, the Brooklyn Youth Chorus and rarely seen footage from the Hubble telescope. A section of the piece is designed to be viewed in virtual reality and virtual-reality headsets will be distributed to up to 6,000 audience members.

The season’s benefit concerts, which require purchased tickets, include Tame Impala (June 14-15), the Lumineers (Aug. 3) and Herbie Hancock (Aug. 11).
