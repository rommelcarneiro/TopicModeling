The technology industry is kicking off this week’s news with a flurry of action.

Earlier Monday, Microsoft announced a $26.2 billion acquisition of the professional social networking site LinkedIn, writes Nick Wingfield. It is the biggest deal in Microsoft’s history and is another move by the software giant’s chief executive, Satya Nadella, to reinvent the company. LinkedIn, which has more than 400 million members, has been struggling with a stock price decline amid questions about its long-term growth.

And later on Monday, Apple will hold its annual developer conference in San Francisco, one of its biggest yearly gatherings. While Apple has long had an understanding with mobile developers — they make games and other programs for the iPhone and iPad and get to be featured on the world’s most-carried devices, and Apple reaps the benefits of many different apps — the company has more recently had to launch a charm offensive to woo developers given how crowded the App Store has become, write Vindu Goel and Katie Benner.

Farhad Manjoo, Brian X. Chen and Vindu Goel will be at Apple’s developer conference to give insight into what you need to know — not what you don’t — from the event. Stay tuned.
