The lawyer for Reza Zarrab, a gold trader based in Turkey who is jailed in Manhattan on charges of conspiring to violate United States sanctions on Iran, proposed on Wednesday that his client be released on $50 million bond with strict conditions to ensure that he would be present for trial.

Mr. Zarrab was arrested in March on a trip to Florida and was sent to New York for prosecution.

In 2013, he was detained by the authorities in Turkey as part of a wide-ranging corruption investigation of businessmen with close ties to Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was then Turkey’s prime minister and is now its president.

Under his lawyer’s proposal, Mr. Zarrab’s bond would be secured by $10 million in cash and he would be required to remain in his New York residence under 24-hour armed guard and GPS monitoring.

The lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said in papers filed in Federal District Court that the office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, had rejected the defense’s bail proposal and wanted Mr. Zarrab detained until trial.

Mr. Brafman noted that if his client did become a fugitive, he not only would lose the $10 million cash bail and be responsible for the remainder of the $50 million bond, but he also “ruins the career of his wife,” Ebru Gundes, a Turkish pop star.

Mr. Brafman asked that the judge, Richard M. Berman, hold a bail hearing for Mr. Zarrab, who has pleaded not guilty. Mr. Bharara’s office had no comment.
