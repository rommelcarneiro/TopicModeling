Savory doughnuts are among the latest from Mark Isreal of Doughnut Plant, who has been in the business since 1994. After moving production to the multiuse Falchi Building in Queens, he has plenty of space to experiment. He calls his filled rectangular creations doughpods. Avocado stuffs one, made with sesame seed dough, while potato and fresh fenugreek (methi) are wrapped inside another. Both are fried in olive oil and sold at his new cafe at Falchi and his other locations. On the sweet side, his newest is a riff on a black-and-white cookie, not only iced with dark and white chocolate but also made so the cake doughnut underneath is half and half as well: Doughnut Plant, Falchi Building, 31-00 47th Avenue (31st Street), Long Island City, Queens, 212-505-3700 extension 310, doughnutplant.com.
