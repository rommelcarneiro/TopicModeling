June is a month of weddings and graduations, leaving men with the challenge of dressing appropriately without succumbing to the heat. Here, we present five lightweight solutions to this annual sartorial dilemma.

The Jeffrey Rüdes label offers a linen suit, in black, that works for any festive summer occasion. “Guys need a more natural feeling about their formal jackets, and that comes with softer construction,” said Mr. Rüdes, who started his namesake brand in 2015.

Another warm-weather option is available from Ralph Lauren: a gossamer-like formal sport coat, in silk, with silk pants. Hermès achieves a similar feel through a different fabric, with an unlined cotton-and-jersey jacket so thin that it’s almost sheer.

From the British designer Margaret Howell comes a linen shawl-collar jacket with a boxy cut. Its distinctive shape suggests a nonchalant formality, and pairing it with a silky pajama shirt emphasizes the effect. The single-breasted linen and wool blazer and pants from Berluti are especially relaxed and easy to wear as well.

All of these choices look great with a traditional shirt and tie, but summer allows for a loosening of the rules. “The key is really in the way that a summer outfit is put together,” Mr. Rüdes said.
