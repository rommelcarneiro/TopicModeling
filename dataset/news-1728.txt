Switzerland closed in on a spot in the next round with a 1-1 draw against Romania in Paris.

Admir Mehmedi scored a 57th-minute equalizer with a powerful left-footed shot to ensure the Swiss had 4 points ahead of their final Group A match, against France.

Romania took the lead against the run of play in the 18th minute when Bogdan Stancu scored with his second penalty kick in two games.

Although Romania hit the post on a first-half shot by Cristian Sapunaru, Switzerland had more and better scoring chances.

Romania has only 1 point from two matches but should be favored to beat Albania in its last match. The new 24-team format means the third-place teams in the six groups have a good chance to reach the round of 16.

Switzerland has never advanced from its group at a European tournament, and it missed a good opportunity to hit Coach Vladimir Petkovicâ€™s target of two straight wins to clinch advancement. (AP)
