Dr. Irim Salik, the daughter of Parveen Salik and Noor M. Salik of Orangeburg, N.Y., was married May 7 to Mahmud Riffat, a son of Nigar Riffat and Imran Riffat of Douglaston, Queens. Kim Kirkley, a minister with First Nation Church, officiated at the Park Savoy Estate, an event space in Florham Park, N.J.

The bride, 33, will continue to use her name professionally. She is a pediatric anesthesiologist with Advance Physicians Services in Valhalla, N.Y. She graduated from N.Y.U. and received a medical degree from Stony Brook University.

Her father, who is retired, was a computer software specialist for the New York City Retirement System in Manhattan. Her mother, also retired, was a teller with the Pearl River, N.Y., branch of Chase bank.

The groom, 30, is a vice president at First Reserve, an investment firm in Greenwich, Conn., where he specializes in energy investments. He graduated from Georgetown and received an M.B.A. from Columbia.

His mother is a senior teller in a Manhasset, N.Y., branch of Chase bank. His father, who is retired, was the senior director and chief financial officer of Synergos, a Manhattan-based nonprofit organization that fights global poverty.

The couple met in October 2011 through the brideâ€™s cousin, who brought Mr. Riffat to a dinner party hosted by Dr. Salik.
