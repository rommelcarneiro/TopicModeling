A 48-year-old man was arrested on Tuesday on charges that he fatally stabbed another man last month during a fight in a subway station in Harlem, the authorities said.

The suspect, Julio Velazquez, faces counts of second-degree murder and criminal possession of a weapon in the March 16 dispute in which Herbert Burgess, 53, was stabbed in the torso at the 116th Street station on Malcolm X Boulevard, the police said.

The authorities gave this account:

Mr. Burgess, selling MetroCard swipes outside the turnstile, took $1 from Mr. Velazquezâ€™s daughter for a swipe. They argued, and she called her father, who lives nearby. He confronted Mr. Burgess and stabbed him.

Mr. Burgess then stumbled onto a No. 2 train. Police officers were called to the next station, Central Park North, where he was found with at least one stab wound, the authorities said. He was pronounced dead at a hospital.

The next day, the police identified Mr. Velazquez as the suspect and released a booking photo of him from a 2013 arrest on charges of criminal possession of a weapon. Investigators found him in Philadelphia, the police said.
