LOS ANGELES — A newly “democratized” nominating process for the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which awards the Oscars, has produced a more prominent, if not more diverse, field of candidates, including Steven Spielberg, Mike Medavoy and James L. Brooks.

On Thursday, the Academy posted on its members-only website a list of more than 60 candidates for 17 open spots on its 54-member governing board. Candidates may now self-nominate, rather than wait for a committee to name them as a possible representative of a craft branch, representing directors, actors, writers and such.

Over all, the four candidates for each of the open spots are roughly one-third women, including Laura Dern among actors, and Amy Pascal, an incumbent, among executives. Edward James Olmos and Lou Diamond Phillips are running against Ms. Dern for a spot held by Ed Begley Jr., who is also in contention.

Others in the running include John Badham and Lisa Cholodenko in the directors branch; Michael Apted and Liz Garbus among documentarians; William M. Mechanic and Peter H. Schlessel among executives; Carter Burwell and Alan Bergman in the music branch; Larry Karaszewski, James Schamus and Robin Swicord among writers; and Stephanie Allain, Mark Johnson, Hawk Koch (a former Academy president) and Paula Wagner among producers.
