Financial and energy companies led a modest increase in United States stocks on Wednesday, giving the market its third gain in a row.

It was helped by a pickup in the price of oil, which climbed about 4 percent. A rise in oil prices tends to favor battered energy stocks and financial companies like banks, which have been in the doldrums because investors worry that loans to struggling oil companies could go bad.

After several weeks of moving in different directions, the stock market appears to be getting more closely tied to the fluctuations in oil prices.

Utilities and consumer staples stocks were among the biggest decliners.

The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index added 1.60 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,102.40. The Nasdaq composite index gained 7.80 points, or 0.2 percent, to 4,948.13. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 42.67 points, or 0.2 percent, to 18,096.27.

The Dow is up almost 4 percent for the year, while the S.&P. 500 is up about 3 percent. The Nasdaq narrowed its loss to 1.2 percent.

Trading got off to a flat start. Major stocks perked up by midmorning as oil prices moved higher, but the rally lost some steam by the end of the day.

United States crude rose $1.55, or 3.8 percent, to settle at $42.63 a barrel. Brent crude, the international benchmark, climbed $1.77, or 4 percent, at $45.80 a barrel in London. Heating oil was up 5.5 percent after adding 7 cents to close at $1.33 a gallon.

That helped lift shares in several energy companies. Chesapeake Energy gained 30 cents, or 4.9 percent, to $6.42, while Williams rose 82 cents, or 4.6 percent, at $18.83.

The market got some encouraging data on housing, with the National Association of Realtors reporting that sales of previously occupied homes bounced back in March after a February slump as the spring selling season began.

The association said that sales of existing homes rose 5.1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.33 million. That followed a 7.3 percent decline in February sales to 5.07 million.

Investors also had their eye on the latest batch of company earnings. Optimism is not high for corporate profits, but with about 15 percent of companies having reported, many have turned in better-than-expected results. “So far, we’re actually seeing companies surprising to the upside,” said Jason Pride, director of investment strategy at Glenmede.

Discover Financial Services led gainers in the S.&P. 500 after it reported better-than-anticipated quarterly profit and sales as loan volume improved. The stock climbed $4.29, or 8.2 percent, to $56.84. VMware also delivered strong results, which vaulted the cloud-computing company $7.07, or nearly 14 percent, to $58.53.

Some companies’ results were disappointing. Coca-Cola shares slid 4.8 percent after the company reported a lower profit for the first quarter. It was the biggest decliner in the S.&P. 500, losing $2.23 to $44.37.

Markets in Europe also closed higher. Germany’s DAX rose 0.7 percent, while the CAC-40 of France gained 0.6 percent. The FTSE 100 of leading British shares added 0.1 percent.

In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline rose about 3 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $1.51 a gallon, and natural gas fell 2 cents to $2.069 per 1,000 cubic feet.
