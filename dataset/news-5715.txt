KEEPING SCORE The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day down 1.1 percent and the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell was down 0.9 percent. The Nasdaq composite index edged down 0.4 percent.

RETAIL ROUT Shares of the department store chain Nordstrom dropped 12.9 percent after the company released disappointing quarterly results late Thursday. J. C. Penney shares dropped 2.5 percent after the company reported disappointing earnings on Friday. Shares of Dillard’s lost 0.3 percent after the company also posted disappointing profit and sales late Thursday.

SILVER LINING The Commerce Department said total retail sales grew 1.3 percent in April, suggesting spending might have rebounded after a weak first quarter. Retail sales slipped in March as car sales decreased.

AT&T stock was declined 0.8 percent, and Verizon shares lost 0.8 percent. Among consumer companies, Walmart shares gave up 2.4 percent and Procter & Gamble stock shed 1 percent.
