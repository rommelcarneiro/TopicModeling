A Queens man was convicted on Tuesday of extorting thousands of dollars from three small businesses in Astoria in a protection racket he ran with the assistance of a New York City police officer.

The man, Redinel Dervishaj, 40, was found guilty after a two-and-a-half-week trial in Federal District Court in Brooklyn. The jury heard evidence that in 2012 and 2013 he coerced money from the owners of several Astoria restaurants and nightclubs.

In one case, prosecutors said, Mr. Dervishaj, the brother of one of Albania’s most wanted fugitives, told the owner of a restaurant that had just opened that it was going to cost him money to run a business in “our neighborhood.” When the restaurateur went to a police officer, Besnik Llaktura, he was unaware that Officer Llaktura, who told him to come up with the money, was working with Mr. Dervishaj. “These people run Astoria,” Officer Llaktura told the man, court papers say.

In another case, Mr. Dervishaj and a third defendant, Denis Nikolla, threatened to beat one of their victims in front of his wife and children, the papers said.

Officer Llaktura, who was formerly assigned to the 120th Precinct on Staten Island, pleaded guilty to extortion in December and has been suspended from his job pending sentencing. Mr. Nikolla, who is of Albanian heritage like the others, is awaiting trial.

Mr. Dervishaj faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.
