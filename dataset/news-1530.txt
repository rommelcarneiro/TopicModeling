Max Martin, the Swedish producer and songwriter who worked on hits for Taylor Swift (“Blank Space”), Britney Spears (“… Baby One More Time”) and Katy Perry (“Teenage Dream”), has been awarded the 2016 edition of Sweden’s Polar Music Prize, along with the Italian mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli. The award comes with a cash prize of one million Swedish krona (about $119,825).

“You blew my cover!” the famously spotlight-averse Mr. Martin (born Martin Sandberg) said in his acceptance speech on Thursday, according to the BBC. “I’ve managed to hide between two speakers in a basement for over 20 years, but you got me!”

The songwriter has “refined and developed the world’s popular music,” according to an announcement by the foundation that administers the prize. “In the last 20 years, no composer in the world has written melodies as sustainable or as widespread as those of Max Martin.”

Ms. Bartoli was cited for her “vocal range of three octaves and a unique ability to live a role with fullness of expression.”

Stig Anderson of Abba established the Polar Music Prize in 1989, aiming to “celebrate music in all its various forms.” King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden attended the ceremony, as did members of the Backstreet Boys, for whom Mr. Martin has also written songs.
