Just for fun, the team at Major Food Group is opening a summer spinoff of Santina in cart form on the street near the restaurant and the Whitney Museum of American Art in the meatpacking district. It sells everything coconut: coconut iced coffee, coconut sundaes and coconut bomboloni. As it evolves, the menu, which mostly offers sweets, is apt to include some savory coconut items, too: Coconut Cart, daily from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., Washington Street near Gansevoort Street.
