Reighan Alexandra Gillam and Milton Sandy Frederick Curry were married May 21 at the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit. The Rev. Deon Johnson, an Episcopal priest, officiated.

The bride, 35, and groom, 51, work in Ann Arbor at the University of Michigan, where she is an assistant professor of communication studies and Afro American and African studies, and he is an associate dean in the Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning.

Dr. Gillam, who is keeping her name, graduated from the University of Virginia and received a Ph.D. in anthropology from Cornell.

She is the daughter of Dorothy J. Gillam and Warren H. Gillam of Harrisburg, Pa. The bride's father retired as a history teacher at William Penn High School in Harrisburg. Her mother retired as a chemist for the State Department of Agriculture, also in Harrisburg.

Mr. Curry graduated from Cornell and received a master's degree in architecture from Harvard.

He is a son of Mary A. Curry and Dr. Ulysses S. Curry of Fresno, Calif. The groomâ€™s father retired as a general practitioner in Fresno.

Mr. Curry first approached Ms. Gillam in August 2008, when she was playing Ms. Pacman at the Pixel Lounge (now closed) in Ithaca, N.Y. She thought that he wanted to play the game, and told him to wait his turn, but he was actually after her phone number.
