WASHINGTON — Three years ago, a Thai student who had helped finance his American education by selling imported textbooks won a major Supreme Court victory, persuading the justices that it is lawful to buy copyrighted books abroad and resell them in the United States. The ruling, which clarified an ambiguous phrase in the Copyright Act, applied to all manner of products, including books, records, art and software.

The student, Supap Kirtsaeng, returned to the Supreme Court on Monday, seeking more than $2 million in legal fees from John Wiley & Sons, the publisher that had sued him.

The usual rule in American civil litigation is that each side pays its own lawyers regardless of who wins. But the Copyright Act allows judges to “award a reasonable attorney’s fee to the prevailing party.”

Federal appeals courts apply different standards in deciding when fee awards in copyright cases are warranted. The judge in Mr. Kirtsaeng’s case, in New York, awarded him nothing, relying on a decision from the federal appeals court there that focused on whether the losing side’s position had been “objectively reasonable.”

The publisher easily met that standard, the judge said, as it had won a $600,000 judgment against Mr. Kirtsaeng, won an appeal and lost in the Supreme Court by a 6-to-3 vote.

E. Joshua Rosenkranz, a lawyer for Mr. Kirtsaeng, told the justices that there was more to the analysis than “just trying to punish those who took unreasonable positions.” The Copyright Act, he said, also sought to ensure that people sued for copyright infringement did not fold at the outset.

“It wanted to encourage parties to advance important principles even where the other side’s arguments are good; indeed, I would say, especially where the other side’s arguments are good,” he said. “When a defendant is trying to decide whether to fight for a principle, the availability of attorneys’ fees can make all the difference in that decision, and in turn can make all the difference in whether the public’s rights are vindicated.”

Several justices appeared unpersuaded by the argument. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg asked whether Mr. Kirtsaeng might just as easily have been dissuaded from mounting a defense for fear of having to pay the publisher’s legal fees.

Justice Elena Kagan agreed. Having won, she said, Mr. Kirtsaeng had “a great David-versus-Goliath story to tell.” In general, though, she said she wondered whether making it easier for the side to recover legal fees “is not going to harm the Kirtsaengs of the world.”

Paul M. Smith, a lawyer for Wiley, made a similar point, saying that making it easy for the winner to recover fees would “suppress litigation.”

“People simply aren’t going to keep fighting,” Mr. Smith said. “They’re going to find a way to get out of the case.”

Mr. Rosenkranz disagreed, saying incentives were needed to ensure that difficult legal questions were resolved, advancing the development of the law.

Justice Stephen G. Breyer said it was often hard to tell when the law was moving forward, and Justice Anthony M. Kennedy spoke up for stability.

“I can see the excitement about granting fees if there’s some breakthrough, something we’ve never thought about,” Justice Kennedy said. “On the other hand, there’s something that’s commendable about applying the law consistently, routinely, in regular cases. That advances the law.”

The case, Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, No. 15-375, opened a window on the cost of litigating a Supreme Court case. Mr. Kirtsaeng’s lawyers sought about $125,000 for their work in the lower courts and $1.9 million for their work in the Supreme Court, including, according to a brief from Wiley, “$531,085.25 for time spent soliciting and coordinating” supporting briefs “from sympathetic business groups.”

Wiley said it had spent $300,000 on its own Supreme Court case, an amount Mr. Kirtsaeng’s lawyers, in their own brief, called a “flat, bargain-basement fee its law firm charged for the firm’s own business reasons.”

Wiley’s brief also noted that Mr. Kirtsaeng “had no obligation whatsoever to pay the Supreme Court counsel who represented him even as they racked up millions of dollars in fees.”

Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. seemed put off by that argument.

“It seems to me that’s quite an intrusion into the relationship between the party and counsel,” he said of inquiries into fee arrangements.
