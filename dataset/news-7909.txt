Cirque du Soleil’s first Broadway venture, “Paramour,” is off to an unusually strong start at the box office, drawing large crowds to see this musical-theater-meets-acrobatics spectacle at the cavernous Lyric Theater.

The show, about a love triangle set in Hollywood’s golden age, grossed just over $1 million for six performances last week, as it begins a long period of previews building toward a scheduled opening on May 25.

At the same time, a revival of “The King and I” took a financial tumble after the departure of its Tony-winning female lead, Kelli O’Hara. The Lincoln Center Theater musical revival, which has been running for a year, grossed $553,790 for eight performances the week ending April 24, down from $1,013,157 the previous week, according to figures released on Monday by the Broadway League. Ms. O’Hara’s replacement, Marin Mazzie, will step into the role on May 3; Analisa Leaming is playing it now.

The spring season is continuing to look grim for several new shows. The musicals “Bright Star,” which opened on March 24, and “Disaster!,” which opened on March 8, are struggling at the box office, as is the play “Eclipsed,” which stars Lupita Nyong’o. The strongest performers among spring musicals remain “Shuffle Along,” which is to open on Thursday, and “Waitress,” which opened on Sunday.

Overall, the 37 shows now on Broadway grossed $27 million last week. The Broadway season, which ends next month, is slightly ahead of last year: Grosses are up 0.6 percent, and attendance is up 1.4 percent.
