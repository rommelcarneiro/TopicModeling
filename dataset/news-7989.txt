Times Insider is hosting an online book club with the Times columnist Frank Bruni — and you’re invited. Join the discussion on Tuesday, May 3, at noon Eastern.

Anxious about college decisions? Anxious about your child’s college decisions?

The New York Times columnist Frank Bruni, the author of the best-selling “Where You Go Is Not Who You’ll Be: An Antidote to the College Admissions Mania,” offers comfort — and a promise.

Mr. Bruni argues that the intensified fixation on exclusive colleges has changed the way we think about and experience college.

• Every Supreme Court justice has an Ivy League degree — and the last four presidents attended Ivy League colleges or graduate schools. Isn’t that proof that some schools matter more than others? (No, says Mr. Bruni.)

• Do exclusive admissions correspond with better education or career opportunities? (Again, no, says Mr. Bruni.)

• If rankings and selectiveness aren’t good criteria for choosing colleges, what’s a better way to think about the process?

Mr. Bruni will be available online to talk about his work and answer your questions on Tuesday, May 3, at noon Eastern. You can start now by submitting comments and questions via the form below.

Have a look at the book. Get started with a quick excerpt — or by listening to Mr. Bruni’s recent Insider podcast. Join up to discuss on May 3.
