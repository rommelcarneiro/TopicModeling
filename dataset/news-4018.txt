Washington lost another landmark on Thursday — but not the marble-column kind.

Johnny’s Half Shell, a Capitol Hill hangout adjacent to the Senate office buildings, celebrated its last night as a crowd of staff members, lobbyists, reporters and other Washington types crowded the New Orleans-style bar and restaurant.

Johnny’s, as it was universally known, provided the setting for too many fund-raisers to count given its proximity to the Capitol, allowing lawmakers and Hill observers the chance to quickly make it back if necessary. It usually wasn’t.

It was also a regular choice for non-clandestine lunches and boisterous happy hours to relive what had just happened, or had not happened, in nearby government buildings.

Before its incarnation as Johnny’s a decade ago, the space was occupied by the French restaurant La Colline, which provided a venue for similar high jinks for nearly 25 years. With Johnny’s moving to a busier neighborhood in Adams Morgan, some other restaurant will no doubt take its place as a Capitol Hill watering hole.
