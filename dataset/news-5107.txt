When Max Verstappen of the Netherlands won the Spanish Grand Prix on Sunday at age 18, he became the youngest driver to win a Formula One race, beating Sebastian Vettel’s record by more than two years.

Verstappen also joined a list of teenagers who have collected grand achievements in sports against grown-ups. Plenty of fans are expecting Verstappen to go on to great things, and for some athletes, teenage success heralds a long career. Others are destined never to match those youthful heights again.

Nineteen appears to be the age when the precocious baseball player breaks out.

Bryce Harper hit 22 home runs in 2012, two short of the teenage record set in 1964 by Tony Conigliaro of the Red Sox. Conigliaro was struck in the face by a pitch and badly injured in 1967; he finished with just 166 career homers.

Mel Ott might have had the best season by a teenager, in 1928 for the New York Giants. He hit .322 with 18 home runs on his way to a Hall of Fame career.

On the pitching side, Dwight Gooden was 17-9 for the Mets in 1984, and Bob Feller was 17-11 for the Indians in 1938; both led the major leagues in strikeouts.

Less well remembered is the amazing season of Wally Bunker in 1964: He was 19-5 with a 2.69 E.R.A. for the Orioles. Like many young pitchers, he was plagued by arm trouble and was out of the majors at 26 with 60 career wins.

After becoming the world’s No. 1 player at 17, Lydia Ko became the youngest ever major winner on the L.P.G.A. Tour at 18, winning the Evian Championships in France in September. She added another major in April, just before her 19th birthday.

Boris Becker’s win at Wimbledon at 17 in 1985 is well remembered, but Michael Chang was more than 100 days younger when he triumphed at the French Open in 1989. Becker won five more Grand Slam titles, Chang none.

Young Tom Morris claimed the British Open in 1868 at 17 and to this day is the youngest major winner in men’s golf. He won three more Opens but died from heart problems at 24.

Wilfred Benitez had his first professional fight at 15. At 17, he won the World Boxing Council light welterweight championship, beating 30-year-old Antonio Cervantes.

Freddy Adu has been a disappointment since signing as a pro with D.C. United at age 14. After many stops, he is now a member of the Tampa Bay Rowdies of the North American Soccer League at 26. But he still holds the record for the youngest United States national team appearance; in 2006, at 16, he came on as a substitute in a friendly against Canada.

Martina Hingis became the youngest major winner when she won the 1997 Australian Open at 16. She won four more Grand Slam singles titles over the next three years, but no more after age 18.

Joe Nuxhall was the youngest ever to play in the major leagues, pitching briefly in a game for the Reds when he was 15 during the wartime player shortages of 1944. It took him eight years to get back to the big leagues, but he eventually pitched respectably until he was 37.

Dominique Moceanu is the youngest of the many young American gymnasts to win an Olympic gold medal. Her medal came in the women’s team competition at the 1996 Atlanta Games at age 14. That record will not be broken under the current rules, which require a gymnast to turn 16 in the calendar year of the Olympics.

The youngest American gold medalist, and officially the youngest from any nation in the Summer Games, is Marjorie Gestring, who won in springboard diving at 13 in 1936 in Berlin. The New York Times described her as “a blond, small and very much tanned child from sunny California.” She would have been favored for another gold in 1940, but those Games were canceled because of World War II.

An even younger athlete took home gold in the Winter Games: Kim Yun-Mi was 185 days younger than Gestring when she was a member of South Korea’s winning short-track speedskating relay team in 1994.

After the Dutch rowing pair of Roelof Klein and François Brandt lost a preliminary heat at the 1900 Olympics in Paris, they suspected the reason was that their coxswain was a man, rather than a child, as the French were using. They recruited a French boy for the final and won. The boy’s name and age are unknown (estimates range from 7 to 12), but he is in all probability the youngest gold medalist ever.
