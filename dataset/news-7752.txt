A police officer went to a home in Queens because a resident had been the victim of a crime. But no one answered and the door was open, the authorities said. Inside, the officer found a home crawling with cats and dogs.

Some had patches of fur missing and crusty eyes. The floors were covered in waste and the ceiling was rotting.

The brick house in the Jackson Heights section had 55 cats, 12 dogs and two turtles, the authorities said. Their caretaker, Elizabeth Grant, 48, was charged on Tuesday with aggravated cruelty to animals and other counts for failing to care for the animals, which prosecutors said were living in “deplorable conditions.”

“The smell of ammonia was so overwhelming, animal rescue workers had to wear respirators to breathe, as well as protective clothing when entering the premises,” said Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney.

The officer noticed the home’s condition on Jan. 6 when looking for Ms. Grant’s mother. The police returned on Jan. 28 and retrieved animals with dental diseases, ear mites, respiratory infections and fur matted with feces and urine.

One dog, Dorothy, had chronic kidney and liver disease and was euthanized. Another dog, Bond, “was in pain with every movement,” prosecutors said. Only two cats had no serious issues.

Richard Bruce Rosenthal, Ms. Grant’s lawyer, said that the animals were not deteriorating, and that the authorities overstated the home’s condition. “This is a situation where the Grants started taking in sick and abandoned thrown-away animals, who were in horrible shape to begin with, and started nursing them back to health,” he said.
