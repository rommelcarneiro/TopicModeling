U.S. stocks climbed Wednesday as investors continued to recover confidence in the health of the global economy. That sent oil prices higher and gave energy companies a lift. Materials companies also climbed higher.

In Europe, the news was fairly bright. a round of new rescue loans for Greece was unfrozen, eliminating the risk the country will default on its debts in the next few months. And a survey of business sentiment in Germany, the largest economy in Europe, rose more than expected.

European stock indexes rose and the U.S. market followed them. Expecting stronger demand for fuel and materials used in industry and construction, investors bought stock in energy and mining and chemicals companies.

Investors “feel confident that perhaps we’re seeing a stabilization of growth overseas,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. “Here in the U.S. the economy appears to be pulling out of the first quarter slump.”
