Marissa Mayer and LeBron James could end up with the same boss. That is, if she sticks around after her company is sold.

Dan Gilbert, the founder of Quicken Loans and majority owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers, has teamed with the famed investor Warren E. Buffett to bid on Yahoo, which recently put itself up for sale. They are joined in a second round of bidding for the Internet company by Verizon Communications, private equity firms such as TPG Capital and a group that includes Bain Capital and Vista Equity Partners, according to a report Sunday by Michael J. de la Merced.

Mr. James, of course, is the star forward of the Cavaliers, making yet another run at the National Basketball Association title. While few would say he’s embattled, Mr. James is certainly under pressure to bring a championship to Northern Ohio.

Ms. Mayer, on the other hand, pretty much defines embattled. She is the latest in a series of chief executives to try — without much success — to turn around Yahoo. And if you can’t fix a company, well, you sell it.

That’s the position Ms. Mayer finds herself in right now. Under pressure from investors, she and Yahoo’s board of directors finally agreed to a sales process earlier this year. It is not clear when that process could end, but Mr. James, no doubt, hopes to claim an N.B.A. title for Cleveland well before then.
