RIO DE JANEIRO — The police in Rio de Janeiro said Friday that they had asked for charges to be filed against seven people in the gang rape of a 16-year-old girl. The case attracted international attention after videos showing men posing with the unconscious victim were posted on social media.

The attack took place on May 21 in an abandoned building in the Morro do Borao district of Rio de Janeiro.

The officer overseeing the investigation, Cristiana Bento, said evidence collected so far showed that three men and a minor took part in the rape, not 33 people as the victim initially suggested. Ms. Bento said she believed that the victim’s statement was a “false memory,” perhaps the result of her drugged state during the attack or the trauma she suffered. The victim is now in a witness protection program.

Ms. Bento said a video that circulated online might have confused the victim. In the video, a suspect says, “This one here, she got pregnant by more than 30,” gesturing toward the naked and unconscious teenager.

The videos and other material that appeared on social media and message-sharing sites alerted the police to what happened and helped them to identify the suspects.

Ms. Bento has asked for charges to be brought against two other people who are accused of helping to circulate the videos online. She is also seeking charges against a gang leader in the Rio de Janeiro area where the rape took place, accusing him of giving the attack his blessing.

Two suspects have been arrested and the rest remain at large.

In Brazil, a defendant convicted of raping a vulnerable victim can be sentenced to a maximum term of 15 years in prison, and a conviction for making a pornographic video of a minor carries a maximum eight-year sentence. Distributing such videos carries a six-year maximum sentence.
