The Mets’ reversal of fortune last season — from years of losing at Citi Field to playing the Kansas City Royals in the World Series — provided a significant lift to the ballpark’s finances. That is not surprising, given that attendance rose 19.5 percent, to 31,725 a game.

And with a 14-7 start this season, including a current seven-game winning streak, the Mets would seem likely to benefit even more from additional attendance and greater spending on concessions and parking. But through nine games, average attendance is down to 31,386.

The team offered a glimpse of its improved 2015 finances in an annual filing that details some of Citi Field’s financial operations. But it is an incomplete picture, because the report excludes revenue from gate receipts from about 30,000 seats, and local and national media, along with expenses like player payroll. The broader picture of the team’s finances, which would indicate whether it is profitable or not, is not available publicly.

The ballpark’s finances showed enormous improvement in three areas, according to the report filed by Queens Ballpark Company, a Mets subsidiary that leases Citi Field from the New York City Industrial Agency, which issued the stadium’s tax-exempt bonds.

Ticket receipts from the most expensive 10,635 seats rose 35 percent to $54.4 million; concession revenue rose 70 percent to $18.3 million; and postseason revenue, which had been nonexistent at Citi Field until last year, was $9.9 million. Luxury suite revenue rose to $9.5 million from almost $8.6 million. Over all, revenue rose 29.6 percent to $151.7 million, and net income more than doubled to $61.1 million.
