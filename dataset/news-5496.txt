The Rev. Jocelyn Corris Cadwallader and Heather Jensen Renwick were married Saturday in Washington. The Rev. Dr. Jeffrey K. Krehbiel officiated at the Presbyterian Church of the Pilgrims.

Ms. Cadwallader (left), 35, is known as J. C. She is the interim associate pastor at Western Presbyterian Church in Washington. She graduated from Appalachian State University in Boone, N.C., and received a masterâ€™s in divinity from McCormick Theological Seminary in Chicago.

She is a daughter of Corris K. Cadwallader and Thomas E. Cadwallader of Wake Forest, N.C.

Ms. Renwick, 32, is a legal director for the Campaign for the Fair Sentencing of Youth, an advocacy and litigation-support group in Washington that is working to change laws that allow some children to be sentenced to life in prison. She graduated from Wake Forest and received her law degree from Northwestern.

She is a daughter of Jacqueline Jensen Renwick and Scott Renwick of Chicago.

The couple met in 2009 in Chicago, when Ms. Renwick began attending services at the church where Ms. Cadwallader was a pastoral resident. But they did not begin dating, in accordance with the church frowning on clergy members developing romantic attachments to parishioners, until after Ms. Cadwallader began a new job, in 2010.
