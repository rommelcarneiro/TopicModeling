Pressed on how he would appeal to women despite his dismal approval ratings with them, Donald J. Trump said in an interview on Fox News on Monday night that he had broken the glass ceiling for women in the construction industry.

“I was the one that really broke the glass ceiling on behalf of women more than anybody in the construction industry, and my relationship, I think, is going to end up being very good with women,” Mr. Trump told the interviewer, Bill O’Reilly.

Hillary Clinton, who The Associated Press said on Monday night had secured enough delegates to become the first female presumptive presidential nominee from a major party, invoked the “glass ceiling” in her concession speech in the 2008 presidential campaign.

Mr. Trump has often pointed to his hiring of women for executive jobs, including his first wife, Ivana, at his company in the 1980s.

Mr. Trump also fended off questions from Mr. O’Reilly about a Boston Globe report showing that there were few women on his campaign, and that they were paid substantially less than men. Mr. Trump insisted that Mrs. Clinton had done the same thing, and said that news accounts had shown this recently, although he did not specify what he was referring to.
