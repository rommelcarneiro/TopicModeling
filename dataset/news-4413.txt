When it comes to high-end outdoor appliances, those who may be planning to upgrade, or would simply enjoy ogling equipment priced north of $10,000, will find plenty to see in the sprawling new Pirch Manhattan kitchen and bath showroom. Shiny stainless-steel units, including one designed by the architect David Rockwell, and pizza ovens, rotisseries and an oversize circular flat-top Mongolian grill are all on display. The company, based in San Diego with branches elsewhere, has chefs on hand to demonstrate, and the store offers cooking classes: Pirch, 200 Lafayette Street (Broome Street), pirch.com.
