Belmont Park is always awash in activity during Belmont Stakes week, but preparations for the 148th running of the race, which was won Saturday afternoon by Creator, were temporarily interrupted by a few odd occurrences during training hours.

On Tuesday, an unraced 2-year-old reared up and landed straddling the inner rail, and he could not move until a team of workers hoisted his legs over the top. On Friday, another young horse threw his rider, lost his bridle and nearly lost his saddle, too, before outriders closed in and one grabbed hold of the horse’s nose to slow him down.

“We tried our best to stop him, and we weren’t able to right away, but the rest of the group was able to pull him up, and we saved the horse,” said Miguel Gutierrez, who has been an outrider for New York Racing Association, which also oversees Saratoga and Aqueduct, for 28 years. “We make a good team.”

During both episodes, an air-raid siren blared, and 20 solar-powered lights around the mile-and-a-half track, the longest in North America, flashed. Those signals alerted riders to keep horses off the track, or if they were already on it, to slow down and steer their mounts to safety until the situation was handled by the eight outriders who were on the track during training. (At least two are on the track for every race.)

By inexpensively adding lights, similar to those used on snow plows, and using remote controls so the units can be activated by outriders or clockers, who have the best vantage points, NYRA has set a standard that rule makers in the industry are asking other tracks to emulate.

“When a jockey’s working a horse in the morning, if it’s a sloppy track, or if they’re working against another horse, between the dirt hitting them and them being in the heat of the moment, they might not hear the siren going off,” said Glen Kozak, NYRA’s vice president for facilities and racing surfaces. “So with the flashing lights, everyone quickly notices there’s trouble.”

He added: “It’s not like I patented this or anything. But it does work very well, and any information that we can pass on to other racetracks, it only helps everybody else in the game.”

Kozak, 45, joined NYRA in 2008 after holding racetrack maintenance jobs in Maryland, Massachusetts and New Jersey. Superintendents are constantly sharing information with one another, and Kozak got the idea for the flashing alarms from a system used in Maryland. He worked with electricians to make NYRA’s wireless.

His crew installed the light system at all three NYRA racetracks about six years ago, but an incident in a race at the Charles Town track in West Virginia in December 2014, in which a horse threw his rider and began running the wrong way as his competitors made their way around the track, accelerated the adoption of emergency warning systems into the Code of Standards used by the National Thoroughbred Racing Association’s Safety & Integrity Alliance to accredit racetracks. Alarms also go off if tractors are on the track when horses enter or if starting gates are stuck. Outriders have learned to be ready for anything.

“The industry realized they didn’t have an efficient way to call off a horse race,” said Steve Koch, the executive director of the alliance. “That’s a situation where the combination of audible and visual signals can quickly alert jockeys and give racetracks the ability to call off a race midrace. These things are critical in morning, but they are even more critical in the afternoons.”

W. B. Rogers Beasley, the vice president of racing at Keeneland Racecourse in Lexington, Ky., noticed the system while visiting the Oklahoma Training Track at Saratoga Race Course and asked Kozak to send him a model. His employees modified the system and placed units around Keeneland’s main track when it was converted to dirt from the synthetic Polytrack in 2014. The units also line the training track there. Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto has also requested one of Kozak’s models.

“They were very well-reviewed by the horseman here,” Beasley said. “It doesn’t stop horses from getting loose, but it certainly increases awareness.”

NYRA’s alarms are built on breakaway poles, so if a horse or a rider were to hit one, it would snap and fall over. A problem arose when the dealers who park cars in Belmont Park’s sweeping lots were moving cars and the wireless remotes caused some alarms to go off. Otherwise, the alarms have helped improve safety and awareness during training and racing.

“It’s a tiny, little example of how things really can work when we’re sharing information and firing on all our cylinders,” Koch said.
