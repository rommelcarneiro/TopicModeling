The Mets already have one pitcher from Long Island, Steven Matz, and they potentially added two more in Thursday night’s amateur draft.

The Mets chose the right-hander Justin Dunn of Freeport, N.Y., and Boston College with the 19th overall pick, and the left-hander Anthony Kay of Stony Brook and the University of Connecticut with the 31st pick. Kay is from the same town as Matz and attended the same high school (Ward Melville).

Baseball America rated Dunn, who started and pitched in relief for the Eagles, as the draft’s 24th-best prospect, and Kay the 35th.

The 6-foot-2, 184-pound Dunn was 4-1 this season with a 1.49 E.R.A. in 17 appearances (seven starts) and two saves. He struck out 66 in 60 ⅓ innings, a career-high 11 coming last week in a seven-inning start against Tulane in an N.C.A.A. regional playoff game.

Kay, at 6 feet and 187 pounds, was 9-2 with a 2.65 E.R.A. in 17 starts for the Huskies, striking out 111 in 119 innings.
