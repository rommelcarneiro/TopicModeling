When workers digging a trench outside the rug designer Luke Irwin’s house (far left) in Wiltshire, England, discovered a preserved Roman mosaic, Mr. Irwin couldn’t believe his good fortune. As he put it, “The chances of being a rug designer and finding a 2,000-year-old floor design 20 yards from your front door have got to be about 20 billion to one.”

The excavation that resulted not only turned up evidence of an enormous Roman villa dating from A.D. 175 to 220, but also inspired Mr. Irwin’s latest rug collection, Mosaic (near left).

“I was so overwhelmed by the scale of the discovery and this elaborate and luxurious footprint from the past,” Mr. Irwin said, but he was nevertheless determined not to simply copy the Roman design. “What was vital was that we used the inspiration of the mosaic as the backdrop, but that the design and color was relevant to 21st-century aesthetics.”

So while the rugs’ texture is reminiscent of a mosaic tile floor, the designs range from orderly geometric patterns to painterly washes of color that look as if they’ve been eroded over time.
