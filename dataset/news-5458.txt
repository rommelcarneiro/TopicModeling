This is the modern domestic box office in microcosm: “Captain America: Civil War” collected about $72.6 million in its second weekend, while “The Jungle Book” in its fifth weekend took in $17.8 million — leaving the only new arrival of note, “Money Monster,” the kind of star-driven movie that used to be Hollywood’s bread and butter, with $15 million in ticket sales.

And the studio behind “Money Monster” was doing cartwheels over that third-place result.

“This isn’t just a win for ‘Money Monster’ — anyone who loves this genre should be cheering,” Sony Pictures, which released the $27 million film through its TriStar division, said in a statement on Sunday. “This is one of the few films aimed squarely at adults this summer, and audiences cast their votes with their ticket stubs. They want to see more of this kind of movie, and they want to see it in theaters.”

“Money Monster,” directed by Jodie Foster and starring George Clooney and Julia Roberts, must still prove itself in the weeks ahead, as studios unleash a barrage of big-budget sequels aimed at families and fans of computer-generated visual effects. If Ms. Foster’s film holds up — “It has the adult audience to itself,” Sony contended — then TriStar will have proven that non-franchise summer entries are viable.

Also arriving in wide release over the weekend was “The Darkness,” a micro-budgeted horror movie from BH Tilt; it took in $5.2 million, a sturdy result for a film of its scale. Art houses also had a good weekend: “The Lobster” (A24), a critical darling that has had a lengthy run on the festival circuit, took in $132,750 from four theaters, the best specialty arrival so far this year.
