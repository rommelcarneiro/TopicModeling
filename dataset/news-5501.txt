Ashley Watson Flanagan and Sean David Kennedy were married May 13 at their home in Washington. Greg M. Selfridge, a friend of the couple who became a Universal Life minister for this event, officiated.

Mrs. Kennedy, 37, is a partner in Flanagan, Fulkerson & Company, a political fund-raising and event planning firm in Washington. She graduated from the University of Richmond.

She is a daughter of Geraldine A. Watson and James R. Watson of Richmond.

Mr. Kennedy, 45, is a senior vice president for global government affairs at Airlines for America, a trade association in Washington. From 2009 to 2011 he was a special assistant for legislative affairs to President Obama. He graduated from Emory University and received a law degree from the Catholic University of America.

He is the son of Mary L. Kennedy and Alan D. Kennedy of Wilmington, Del.

The bride’s previous marriage ended in divorce, as did the groom’s.

The couple met in Washington in 2012 while working at a fund-raiser for Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, who was seeking re-election.
