It’s easy to spot first-time visitors to the Onassis Cultural Center in Manhattan. They’re the people shaking their heads in disbelief at the art treasures they’ve come across — free — in basement galleries in a Fifth Avenue high-rise next to St. Patrick’s Cathedral. And the center’s current show, “Gods and Mortals at Olympus: Ancient Dion, City of Zeus,” truly is a wonder: a trove of ancient artifacts, excavated over some four decades, from a city that flourished on the lower slopes of Mount Olympus in northern Greece under the Macedonian king Archelaus I, great-grandfather of Alexander the Great.

Organized by Dimitrios Pandermalis, president of the new Acropolis Museum in Athens, the exhibition includes extraordinary marble sculpture, mosaics and jewelry from the city’s religious sanctuaries, thermal baths and cemeteries, displayed in an installation filled with the sounds of birds and wildlife that inhabit the site today. No matter how you plan to approach the show — just go for it. (onassisusa.org.)
