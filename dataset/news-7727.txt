The campfire comedy of “Wet Hot American Summer” is far from extinguished: On Wednesday, Netflix said that it was ordering a new series in this surprisingly durable franchise about kids and counselors at a fictional 1980s summer camp — one that will take viewers a decade ahead in the lives of its characters.

The new series, called “Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,” will be a serialized sequel to the 2001 feature film “Wet Hot American Summer,” a cult hit that provided an early showcase for future stars like Amy Poehler, Elizabeth Banks, Paul Rudd and Bradley Cooper.

Last year, Netflix released “Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp,” an eight-episode series set a few weeks before the events of the original film, which reunited the many members of its now-accomplished cast while adding new characters played by Jon Hamm, Kristen Wiig, Michael Cera and Weird Al Yankovic, among others. “Ten Years Later,” another eight-episode narrative that will fast-forward to the era of Beanie Babies, big-haired boy bands and the Persian Gulf war, will be written by David Wain and Michael Showalter, the creators of “Wet Hot American Summer,” and directed by Mr. Wain. Netflix said the new series was planned for release next year.
