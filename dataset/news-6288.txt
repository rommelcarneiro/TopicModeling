CHARLOTTE, N.C. — James Hahn beat Roberto Castro with a par on the first hole of a sudden-death playoff on Sunday in the Wells Fargo Championship, ending a three-month slump.

Hahn, who failed to make the cut in his previous eight tournaments and had not shot a round in the 60s since February, made a 4-foot putt on the par-4 18th at Quail Hollow Club to win his second career PGA Tour title.

“You have to keep believing in yourself and keep grinding,” Hahn said. “I constantly remind myself that I am good enough and belong out there.”

Castro’s tee shot on the playoff hole found the creek on the left side of the fairway, and his third shot landed in a spectator’s shoe on the side of the green, leading to a bogey.

Hahn bogeyed the 18th in regulation for a two-under-par 70, and Castro had a 71 to finish at nine under, one shot ahead of Justin Rose (71).

Rory McIlroy and Phil Mickelson both shot 66 to tie for fourth at seven under with the third-round leader Rickie Fowler (74) and Andrew Loupe (71).

Both Castro and Hahn had chances to win in regulation.

Castro broke a tie when he rolled in a birdie putt from 6 feet on the 15th hole to get to 11 under. But he quickly gave up the lead with bogeys at 16 and 17 on the Green Mile, the toughest closing holes on the PGA Tour.

That gave Hahn a one-shot lead and a chance to put pressure on Castro on the 18th hole if he made par. But Hahn rolled a 7-foot putt past the hole and took a bogey.

Castro, playing with Fowler in the group behind Hahn, got up and down from the rough on right side of the fairway on 18 and went on to make a 6-foot par putt to force the playoff.

As it had for Castro, the 18th hole ultimately proved to be the undoing of McIlroy and Mickelson, too.

McIlroy played the 493-yard hole in four over par for the week, including a bogey Sunday when his approach shot landed behind a rock on the other the side of the creek that runs along the left side of the hole.

McIlroy had seven birdies between his bogeys on the first and last holes.

“Anytime you walk off the golf course and shoot 66, you can’t be too disappointed,” McIlroy said. “But I think in the circumstances, having a feeling like I had a chance on the back nine to post a number for the guys to at least think about it, and I didn’t.”

McIlroy also took a gut shot on 15 when he failed to hole a birdie putt, prompting him to drop his hands to his knees as he bent over in disbelief.

Despite the playoff loss, Castro refused to the dwell on the negative.

“Sure, it hurts to let this tournament specifically slip away, but there are 154 guys that didn’t have a chance in that playoff, and I feel grateful to have had a chance,” he said.
