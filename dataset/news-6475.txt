On this week’s Popcast: the success and conservatorship of Britney Spears.

Britney Spears has come a long way since her so-called meltdown in 2008: last fall she signed a two-year extension of her performance residency at Caesar’s Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas — a $35-million deal — and she’s working on a new record. She has accomplished all this while living with the restrictions of a court-approved conservatorship.

In an article published this week in The New York Times, Serge Kovaleski and Joe Coscarelli write: “Ms. Spears cannot make key decisions, personal or financial, without the approval of her conservators: her father, Jamie Spears, and a lawyer, Andrew M. Wallet. Her most mundane purchases, from a drink at Starbucks to a song on iTunes, are tracked in court documents as part of the plan to safeguard the great fortune she has earned but does not ultimately control.” Ms. Spears is 34 now; this is a rare situation for a young, successful figure living in the public eye.

Our guests are the Times reporters Mr. Kovaleski, Mr. Coscarelli, and the Times pop music editor Caryn Ganz, talking about how conservatorships work in general, what there is to be known about Ms. Spears’s life these days — either from reporting or from simply looking at her Instagram feed — and the details of her “Piece of Me” show at Planet Hollywood.
