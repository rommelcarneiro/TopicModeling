The Spanish league title race will go down to the final round, with rivals Barcelona and Real Madrid still in contention.

Barcelona routed its crosstown rival Espanyol, 5-0, at home on Sunday to solidify its lead going into next weekend, when another victory would secure Barcelona its second consecutive title.

Luis Suárez scored twice, with Lionel Messi, Neymar and Rafinha adding one goal each at the Camp Nou. The win kept Barcelona 1 point in front of Real Madrid, which defeated visiting Valencia, 3-2, with two goals from Cristiano Ronaldo and one by Karim Benzema.

Atlético Madrid, which was tied in points with Barcelona before this weekend, dropped out of contention after a surprising 2-1 loss at already relegated Levante. Atlético was chasing its second league title in three seasons.

In the final round, Barcelona will play at Granada, which was fighting against relegation Sunday but secured its place in the top flight with a 4-1 win at Sevilla.

Real Madrid will play at Deportivo La Coruña, which will not have anything to play for in the last round.

Barcelona will be trying to win its sixth league title in eight seasons, while Madrid is hoping to lift the trophy for the first time since 2012.

CHAMPIONS LEAGUE RACE Manchester City tied Arsenal, 2-2, in the English Premier League to throw into doubt its return to the Champions League next season. Alexis Sánchez earned third-place Arsenal a point with a 68th-minute equalizer at Etihad Stadium.

After limping away with a right knee injury, the England striker Danny Welbeck could be a doubt for the European Championship.

Even more galling, City’s great rival — Manchester United — is the team that could grab the Champions League qualification berth. Fourth-place City is two points ahead of United, which has two games left — against West Ham and Bournemouth — to City’s one.

Also Sunday, Tottenham lost, 2-1, at home to Southampton but is assured of a top-three finish and automatic qualification to the Champions League. Liverpool beat visiting Watford, 2-0, on goals by Joe Allen and Roberto Firmino to stay in eighth place.

HIGUAíN LIFTS NAPOLI Napoli won, 2-1, at Torino to improve its chances of qualifying for the Champions League, while Roma celebrated Francesco Totti’s 600th Serie A appearance with a 3-0 win over Chievo Verona.

Gonzalo Higuaín scored his 33rd goal as Napoli moved back into the second spot, restoring its 2-point advantage over Roma.

Also, Luca Toni chipped in a penalty to set bottom-dwelling Hellas Verona on its way to a surprise 2-1 home victory over Juventus.

FRANCE HONORS IBRAHIMOVIC Paris St.-Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic was voted the French league’s player of the year for a third time.

Ibrahimovic beat competition from his teammate Ángel Di María, Marseille midfielder Lassana Diarra and Nice winger Hatem Ben Arfa.

Ibrahimovic has scored a season-best 35 goals in the French league. He is the first player to score more than 30 in a season in France’s top division since Carlos Bianchi scored 37 in 1977-78.
