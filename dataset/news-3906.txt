If the choreographer Raja Feather Kelly prays, it must be to Andy Warhol, the muse for a handful of works that Mr. Kelly has created for his company, the Feath3r Theory, since 2009. The latest is “Andy Warhol’s Tropico,” which takes inspiration from Lana Del Rey’s 27-minute extended music video, “Tropico,” a dramatic meditation on original sin and redemption in which Jesus, John Wayne, Marilyn Monroe and Elvis appear as saintlike figures while Ms. Del Rey morphs from Eve to Mary to a modern-day stripper.

Mr. Kelly’s take will have a lighter touch, a flirty wink and a queer sensibility that dispenses with spiritual heaviness and treats pop culture as a kind of religion itself. (He has also created an accompanying graphic novel.) With deadpan wit and a 12-member ensemble embodying archetypes from movies, television and children’s stories, Mr. Kelly’s fusion of dance and theater shifts seamlessly from absurd to cheeky to the unexpectedly and piercingly sincere.
