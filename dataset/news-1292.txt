Heather Delene Casteel, a daughter of Cathy D. Casteel and Michael A. Casteel of Seattle, was married June 18 to David Rodriguez, a son of Elena Rodriguez and Benedicto Rodriguez of Glendale, Queens. The Rev. Timothy Dore, a Roman Catholic priest, performed the ceremony at Most Holy Trinity-St. Mary church in Brooklyn.

The couple, both 31, met in 2002 at Williams College, from which they graduated, but they didn’t begin dating until 2014 when Mr. Rodriguez recognized Ms. Casteel’s profile on Tinder.

The bride, who will continue to use her name professionally, is an associate in the trusts and estates department at the Manhattan law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. She received a law degree magna cum laude from Harvard.

Her father, who is retired, was a founder and the chief technology officer of Unison Software, a company that was in Santa Clara, Calif.

The groom is the senior strategist at FXCM, an online foreign exchange broker in Manhattan, where he produces research for clients on global financial markets.

His parents own Edwin Travel Agency in Brooklyn and are co-owners of Cari Wine Bar and Restaurant in Manhattan.
