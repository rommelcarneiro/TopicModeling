Jack Gleeson, known to “Game of Thrones” fans as the nefarious King Joffrey, will star in “Bears in Space,” coming at the end of the summer to 59E59 Theaters.

The summer season at 59E59, to be announced on Monday, will start as always with “East to Edinburgh,” which will run July 12 to 31. This annual festival features several American productions doing what are essentially warm-up performances before they are staged in Scotland in August at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.

New Jersey Repertory Company’s production of “Butler,” a Civil War comic-drama by Richard Strand that had a well-received premiere in Long Branch in 2014, will run July 14 to Aug. 28. (There are three theaters at the 59E59 complex, along with the always buzzing E:Bar). And the annual Summer Shorts festival is scheduled for July 22 to Sept. 3. Neil LaBute; Cusi Cram; and Alexander Dinelaris, one of the screenwriters behind the Academy Award-winning film “Birdman,” are among the playwrights contributing brief new works for Summer Shorts this year.

The summer slate will also include Robin Rice’s “Alice in Black and White” (Aug. 3 to 14), “Touch,” by Toni Press-Coffman (Aug. 18 to Sept. 4) and Hershey Felder in “Maestro” (Aug. 31 to Oct. 16). Mr. Felder, pianist, composer and playwright, plays the role of Leonard Bernstein in this show that combines narrative and Bernstein’s compositions to tell his life story.

Opening just after Labor Day is Mr. Gleeson’s show, “Bears in Space,” a quirky adventure featuring music and puppets, about two bears on a spaceship being chased across the universe by villains. The show, which also stars Aaron Heffernan, Cameron Macaulay and Eoghan Quinn, comes to New York after productions in Dublin, London and Edinburgh, and will run Sept. 6 to Oct. 2. The fall season at 59E59 will start with Conor McPherson’s “The Birds” (Sept. 9 to Oct. 2) and additional shows will be announced later.
