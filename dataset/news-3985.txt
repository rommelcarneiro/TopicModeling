The Vision Festival, which runs in Manhattan June 7 through June 12, has started a fund-raising campaign after losing support from several key outlets, including New York’s Department of Cultural Affairs.

The festival, which The New York Times’s Nate Chinen described last year as an “essential summit of experimental jazz and related undercurrents in poetry, dance and visual art,” is organized by the nonprofit Arts for Art. The festival does not receive support from major corporations and has relied on the city’s funding for the past 18 years. Patricia Parker, Arts for Art’s founder, said the city awarded the organization around $20,000 annually for the event.

However, this year, a governmental panel made up of representatives from the cultural sector and City Council declined the festival’s application. This loss of financing, combined with the withdrawal of several other major donors, led Ms. Parker to start an online campaign with the goal of raising $50,000.

“Arts for Art has not gotten to the place where it can protect itself easily,” Ms. Parker said.

Many musicians, including John Zorn, Wadada Leo Smith and Myra Melford, signed a letter asking for support.

Mr. Smith played at the Vision Festival in 2008 with his Golden Quintet and included that performance on the double album “Spiritual Dimensions.” He will perform this year in several configurations, including with a dancer. “It’s a fantastic festival, one of a kind,” Mr. Smith said in an interview.

As of Thursday, May 26, the campaign had raised approximately $36,000, much of it from small donations, Ms. Parker said. This year’s festival, which will be held in Judson Memorial Church and feature the Sun Ra Arkestra and Henry Grimes will continue as planned, Ms. Parker said: “Come hell or high water, we’ll get through it.”
