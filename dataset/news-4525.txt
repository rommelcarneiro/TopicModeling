LONDON — The American fertilizer maker CF Industries said on Monday that it had called off an $8 billion deal to acquire several European and North American operations from OCI of the Netherlands because of a crackdown by the United States on so-called tax inversions.

Inversions have gained popularity in recent years as American companies look to lower their corporate tax rates and more easily use income that has been held in foreign subsidiaries. But those deals have faced resistance from the United States government.

In April, the Treasury Department, in conjunction with the Internal Revenue Service, announced a series of new rules meant to further curtail the practice. The first deal to fall victim to those new rules was Pfizer’s $152 billion merger with Allergan.

CF Industries and OCI said on Monday that the new rules reduced the benefits of their proposed transaction, and that they were unable to restructure it in a way that would be attractive to their shareholders.

“Although the original deal created significant value for both parties, changes in the regulatory and commercial environments forced us to re-evaluate the combination and led us to the conclusion that terminating the agreement is in the best interests of CF Industries and its shareholders,” Tony Will, the CF Industries president and chief executive, said in a news release.

The OCI deal, announced in August, would have created the world’s largest publicly traded nitrogen company.

The transaction, worth $8 billion, including debt, was structured so that CF Industries would become a subsidiary of a new holding company based in Britain. OCI’s European, North American and global distribution businesses would have become part of the new company.

CF Industries, based in Deerfield, Ill., will pay a termination fee of $150 million to OCI after the deal’s collapse.

A move by the Obama administration to begin to tighten rules on inversions in 2014 killed some deals, including AbbVie’s planned $54 billion takeover of its Irish counterpart Shire. But those rule changes ultimately failed to stem the tide of American companies seeking foreign partners to reduce their tax rates.

In April, the administration moved to make inversions even tougher to carry out, particularly by foreign companies that have completed multiple deals with American partners in a short period, which United States authorities have described as “serial inverters.”
