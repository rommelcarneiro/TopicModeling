FLINT, Mich. — The Flint city worker who was one of three people charged last month in connection with the city’s water crisis, has agreed to cooperate with investigators in exchange for reduced charges.

The city employee, Michael Glasgow, Flint’s laboratory and water quality supervisor, had been charged with tampering with lead testing reports, a felony punishable by five years in jail, and with willful neglect of duty, a misdemeanor.

On Wednesday, prosecutors threw out the tampering charge and Mr. Glasgow pleaded no contest to the misdemeanor on the condition that he continue to cooperate with state and federal investigators, who have said that more arrests in relation to the crisis are on the way.

A deal for Mr. Glasgow’s cooperation was widely anticipated. His arrest came as a surprise to some, as he had voiced concerns over the decision to switch the city’s water supply to the Flint River from Lake Huron in 2014. When no corrosion controls were added after the switch at Flint’s water treatment plant, pipes started leaching lead, poisoning much of the city’s water.

The deal came with conditions. Judge Jennifer Manley of Genesee District Court said the court would revisit the agreement every three months to make sure that Mr. Glasgow is holding up his end of the bargain. Robert Harrison, Mr. Glasgow’s lawyer, called the arrangement “unusual” but said Mr. Glasgow was pleased to contribute to the investigation.

Todd Flood, special counsel for the state’s investigation into the Flint water crisis, said “it’s possible” that all charges could be dropped after one year. “He has to fulfill the conditions,” Mr. Flood said.

Mr. Flood declined to comment on what information Mr. Glasgow could contribute to further investigations. When asked how crucial Mr. Glasgow’s cooperation was, he said, “I wouldn’t have done it if it wasn’t.”

A hearing on Wednesday for the other people arrested so far, two state Department of Environmental Quality workers, was postponed.
