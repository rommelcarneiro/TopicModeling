Podcasts have become fixtures of commutes and working hours, but they’re entering museums, too. Nate DiMeo, creator of the podcast “The Memory Palace,” will be the 2016-17 artist in residence at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Announcing a new season of its MetLiveArts series on Thursday, the Met moved ever further from its traditional helpings of standard-repertory concerts and podium lectures. Instead, it is looking to engage audience members who might resist being tied to a particular performance time or space and would prefer to listen at leisure to Mr. DiMeo, who will work with the Met’s curators and conservators on 10 podcasts about objects in the American Wing.

The quartet in residence will be PubliQuartet, which incorporates improvisation and contemporary compositions into its performances of the canon. New and recent works, including John Luther Adams’s “Canticles of the Holy Wind” and Mohammed Fairouz’s “Al-Quds: Jerusalem,” are a feature of the season, which was organized by Limor Tomer, the Met’s general manager of concerts and lectures.

In honor of the 90th anniversary of the birth of Morton Feldman (who died in 1987), the Calder Quartet will play his six-hour String Quartet No. 2 in the Fuentidueña Chapel at the Cloisters. Handel and Haydn Society, a Boston orchestra under Harry Christophers, will perform Monteverdi’s Vespers of 1610 in the Temple of Dendur.

Alan Cumming will give the premiere of “Max and Alan,” a musical work inspired by the Met’s “Max Beckmann in New York” exhibition this fall. And Judy Collins will have a two-night stand of songs by Sondheim.
