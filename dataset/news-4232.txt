The end is in sight for Philip and Elizabeth Jennings.

“The Americans,” an FX drama that has received middling ratings but nearly universal acclaim from critics, will end in 2018, FX announced Wednesday. This means that the show, currently in its fourth season, will have two more: One with 13 episodes in 2017 and a sixth and final one in 2018, which will have 10 episodes.

“The Americans,” which debuted in 2013, tracks the geopolitical skulduggery and domestic angst of married Soviet agents, played by Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys, posing as travel agents in the 1980s in the suburbs of Washington. It was inspired by a real-life covert spy ring in New Jersey.

“The physical danger in ‘The Americans,’” James Poniewozik wrote in The New York Times, “makes it thrilling. The emotional danger makes it irresistible.”

In an interview with The New York Times in March, Joe Weisberg and Joel Fields, the co-showrunners, indicated that the show would end within two more seasons. Wednesday’s announcement makes that official.

“We have no doubt that this two-season order will allow Joe and Joel to tell this story to its perfect conclusion,” Eric Schrier, president of original programming for FX, said in a statement.
