The outdoor cooking season inevitably starts off with a crop of grilling and barbecuing guides. “The Total Grilling Manual” includes solid advice on equipment and safety, how much charcoal to light for various situations, and different cuts of meat and how best to prepare them. There’s a global array of recipes, a trick for testing ribs and another for using a mayonnaise slather so fish won’t stick. But cook chicken to an internal temperature of 170 to 180 degrees? I disagree; 160 is more like it: “The Total Grilling Manual,” edited by Lisa Atwood (Welden Owen, $29).
