The Orlando Magic completed a whirlwind week on Friday by formally announcing Frank Vogel as their new head coach. He has the playoff experience the team wanted, leading the Indiana Pacers to four playoff appearances in his five full seasons with the team.

Vogel replaces Scott Skiles, who surprised the organization when he resigned on May 12. Vogel’s Indiana teams were usually one of the top defensive clubs in the N.B.A. but he did not have his contract renewed after this season. The Pacers made the playoffs but were bounced in Game 7 of the first round by the Toronto Raptors.

The Magic are building around young players like Nikola Vucevic, Aaron Gordon, Victor Oladipo and Elfrid Payton and also say they want to re-sign forward Evan Fournier, who will hit the free-agent market in July.

An M.V.P. Debate Consider Gary Payton unimpressed by Golden State guard Stephen Curry becoming the first unanimous most valuable player in N.B.A. history.

Payton, who was known as one of the N.B.A.’s great trash talkers during his 18-season Hall of Fame career, told Sports Illustrated that the vote just “happened to go” Curry’s way. He said players like Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar also could have been considered unanimous picks even though the vote did not go that way.

The Texas Rangers could be playing in a new $1 billion retractable-roof stadium by 2021 and would remain in Arlington, Tex., until at least 2054 under plans revealed by the team and the city.

The proposed agreement for a public-private partnership calls for a 50-50 split of the estimated cost of the stadium and related infrastructure, with the city’s portion capped at $500 million. Arlington voters in November are expected to be asked to support the project by continuing existing sales taxes that are used to help pay for $1.2 billion AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.

Around the Majors Tim Lincecum signed a one-year, $2.5 million deal with the Los Angeles Angels, giving the injury-plagued team additional depth for its rotation. A two-time National League Cy Young Award winner, Lincecum had left hip surgery on Sept. 3. The Athletics’ Josh Reddick will probably miss at least a month after fracturing his thumb on a spike while stealing second base. Four minor leaguers were suspended after testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs. Toronto outfielder David Harris and Seattle pitcher Jose Luis Santiago will miss 76 games, while Dodgers pitcher Sebastian Martinez and Colorado pitcher Jose Rodriguez will miss 72 games.

New padded robots operated by remote control are being used by the Pittsburgh Steelers in off-season workouts, with more potentially available to N.F.L. teams next year.

The Mobile Virtual Players — dummies on wheels that can weave, change direction, speed up and stop — are being used as more than simulated tackling surrogates by Steelers Coach Mike Tomlin, who has them testing receivers and rushers. The robots were developed and first used at Dartmouth College and are quickly helping the Steelers hone their skills without man-on-man drills.

Brendan Rodgers was hired as the new coach of the Scottish champion Celtic seven months after being fired by Liverpool. He is replacing Ronny Deila, who left after guiding Celtic to its fifth straight Scottish league title.
