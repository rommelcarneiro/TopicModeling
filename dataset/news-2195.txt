To the Editor:

In her column on 401(k) retirement plans (“When Duty to Retirees Comes Last,” Fair Game, June 5), Gretchen Morgenson notes, in the case of Kodak, that plan participants who file claims and lose “must pay all the Kodak plan’s fees and expenses incurred defending against the suit.”

Surely, any sense of fairness demands that the plan pay the fees and expenses of plan participants if they win.

Further, it is not always clear which party is the winner in a lawsuit. Some parts of a claim may be granted and other parts denied. In those situations, neither party should pay the costs of the other unless the court is authorized to allocate costs based on its assessment of the merits of each party’s case.
