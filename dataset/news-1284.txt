Ms. Ellman-Amerine, 38, is a partner at the Washington law firm Hogan Lovells, where she is a co-leader of the practice handling law relating to commercial drones. She is also a co-executive director of the Commercial Drone Alliance, a trade group with headquarters in Washington and in Menlo Park, Calif.

She graduated from the University of Michigan and received a law degree and a master’s degree in public policy from the University of Chicago. From 2008-2014, she was a presidential appointee at the White House and the Justice Department, most recently as a senior counsel developing drone policy at the Justice Department.

She is the daughter of Carol J. Ellman and Howard S. Ellman of Bloomfield Hills, Mich.

Mr. Amerine, 45, is a fellow at New America, a public policy institute in Washington. He retired from the Army last year as a lieutenant colonel, having served as an operations branch chief on the Army staff in Washington. He had been the leader of a Special Forces unit, and served during the invasion of Afghanistan, bringing Hamid Karzai back into the country to begin the guerrilla campaign at the outset of the conflict.

He graduated from the United States Military Academy and received a master’s degree in international affairs from Texas A&M. He was awarded the Legion of Merit for his work on the Army staff, including work to change how the government manages hostage recoveries. He also received a Bronze Star with valor and Purple Heart for service in Afghanistan.

The groom is the son of Ronald L. Amerine of Mountainview, Ark., and the late Carol A. Amerine. His previous marriage ended in divorce.

The couple met in 2012 through a mutual friend in Washington.
