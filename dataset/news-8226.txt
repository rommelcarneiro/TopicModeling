Federal authorities are investigating the disappearance of hundreds of pounds of explosives, in the form of commercial fireworks, missing from a CSX freight train, a spokesman for the company said Friday.

The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is investigating the disappearance of the fireworks from a train that originated in Chicago, said the spokesman, Rob Doolittle. The explosives were determined to be missing on Wednesday.

“CSX reported the theft as soon as it was discovered, upon the train’s arrival in Detroit,” Mr. Doolittle said.

No cars were detached from the train; the material was unloaded, Mr. Doolittle said.

An A.T.F. spokesman called the suspected theft “a very serious case,” according to CBS News, which reported on it on Friday. Mr. Doolittle said a “quantity” of fireworks were stolen but did not elaborate. CBS reported that at least 32 cases, or more than 500 pounds, were missing.

The commercial fireworks are classified as explosives, Mr. Doolittle said. CBS reported that the quantity of the fireworks made them extremely dangerous.

Mr. Doolittle referred additional comment to the A.T.F. because it was an active investigation. A bureau spokesman could not be reached for additional details on Friday night.
