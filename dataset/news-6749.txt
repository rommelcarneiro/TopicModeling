PITTSBURGH — Patric Hornqvist beat Braden Holtby in overtime to give the Pittsburgh Penguins a 3-2 victory over the Washington Capitals on Wednesday night in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference semifinals.

Washington’s Mike Weber tried to clear a shot, but the puck went right to Hornqvist in the circle. He buried it for his fifth goal of the postseason and gave the Penguins a three-games-to-one lead in the best-of-seven series. Game 5 will be Saturday in Washington.

The Penguins had lost their last eight overtime playoff games.

Matt Cullen and Trevor Daley also scored for Pittsburgh, and the rookie goaltender Matt Murray stopped 34 shots.

Jay Beagle and John Carlson scored for Washington.
