Lionel Messi trained alongside his Argentina teammates at the Copa América Centenario on Wednesday and said he was hopeful he could return from a back injury in his team’s second group-stage game against Panama on Friday in Chicago.

Messi, who has been nursing a sore back since sustaining an injury in an exhibition against Honduras last month, has trained separately under the supervision of the team’s medical staff since arriving in the United States.

But Messi, who also plays for Barcelona, took part in a full training session Wednesday at the University of Illinois campus, two days after he sat out Argentina’s opening 2-1 victory over Chile.

In a short message on his Facebook page, Messi, 28, wrote that he wanted to make a swift return to Argentina’s starting lineup.

“I hope to be ready as soon as possible to help the team,” Messi wrote.

A victory against Panama would almost certainly guarantee a place in the quarterfinals for Argentina with one game remaining in Group D.

TROUBLING TYPO The organizers of the Copa América have had a rough first week. On Sunday, stadium officials in Arizona played the wrong national anthem before a match. On Tuesday, the event’s official Twitter account misidentified a Costa Rican player as a Colombian.

Now it is Adidas that has been forced to apologize after the company misspelled Colombia in advertisements promoting the team’s new jerseys for the tournament.

The ads, which showed Colombian players in their new white jerseys, were pulled by Adidas after social media widely ridiculed the company for spelling the country “Columbia.”

“We value our partnership with the Colombian Football Federation and apologize for our mistake,” Adidas said in a statement. “We removed these graphics and are quickly installing new versions today.”

A PREMIER LEAGUE VICTORY Spain may have an iron grip on Europe’s club competitions, but England’s Premier League is the dominant power when it comes to the number of players headed to the European Championship in France this month.

Spain has won the last two European championships, and La Liga clubs have claimed Europe’s major club trophies, the Champions League and Europa League, for the last three seasons.

Yet a quarter of the 552 players preparing for Euro 2016 play in the English league, nearly four times as many as those from La Liga, according to figures from the online betting firm Grosvenor Casinos.

While no English club has won a European trophy since Chelsea claimed the Europa League in 2013, England still appears to be the most popular destination for international players.

Even the Bundesliga, where 13 members of world champion Germany’s 23-man squad earn their livings, is dwarfed by the Premier League in terms of the number of players at this year’s Euros. More than twice as many players competing at the Euros play in England than play in Germany.

SECURITY CONCERNS Germany defender Jerome Boateng said this week that because of security concerns he would feel safer if his family did not attend his games at the European Championship.

The 27-year-old Boateng, a key player for Germany at Euro 2016, was quoted by Sportbild magazine Wednesday as saying that his family and children would not come to the stadium because “the risk is too great for me.”

“On one hand, of course, it’s sad that you have to deal with such issues; on the other hand, many things have happened that make you thoughtful,” said Boateng, referring to recent terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels. “I for one just want to concentrate on the football at the European Championship, and I feel better if my family is not sitting in the stadium.” (AP)
