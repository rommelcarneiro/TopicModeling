On Wednesday, a federal judge will sentence J. Dennis Hastert, the former speaker of the House, for avoiding federal banking requirements in what prosecutors say was an effort to cover up his sexual abuse of high school wrestlers decades ago when he was a coach. He pleaded guilty in October to the banking violation, which can carry as much as five years in prison. Mr. Hastert, 74, suffered a stroke in November; his lawyers are seeking probation. There is a trail of documents leading to the sentencing hearing:

Under a plea agreement Mr. Hastert reached with federal prosecutors in October, prosecutors dropped one felony charge, and Mr. Hastert admitted to another — namely, structuring financial transactions to evade bank reporting requirements.

Federal prosecutors filed this sentencing memo this month. It gave the first details of the sexual abuse accusations against Mr. Hastert. The prosecutors say at least four wrestling team members described abuse, including “intentional touching of minors’ groin area and genitals or oral sex with a minor.” Mr. Hastert is not charged with sexual abuse, for which statutes of limitation would by now have run out.

Mr. Hastert’s lawyers answered the prosecution’s sentencing memo with this:

In a sentencing memo from Mr. Hastert’s defense team filed this month, his lawyers say he should get probation. They note that he has apologized, is “overwhelmed by the guilt he feels,” and has in recent months contended with a series of medical problems: a stroke, a spinal infection and sepsis, a bloodstream infection.

More than 40 letters were submitted by Mr. Hastert’s lawyers to a federal judge who is to decide his sentence on Wednesday. The writers included his wife, other relatives, former politicians and political operatives in Washington and Illinois, lawyers, former law enforcement leaders, former students and fellow wrestling coaches. Here are a few of them:
