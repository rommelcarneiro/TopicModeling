Core Media Group, the company behind the television shows “American Idol” and “So You Think You Can Dance,” filed for bankruptcy protection on Thursday.

Core, based in West Hollywood, Calif., estimated its liabilities at $512 million and assets at $73 million, according to court records.

“American Idol” concluded its 14-year run last month, with its final show drawing 13.3 million viewers. At its height 10 years ago, it routinely attracted 30 million viewers per episode. However, as the show’s ratings began to wane, so did its financial fortunes.

“The decline in overall economics and the announced cancellation of the 2017 season of ‘American Idol’ on Fox negatively impacted the revenues and profits of the debtor’s business,” the court papers said.

“Additional negative ripple effects included, among other things: a decline in re-broadcast fees due to reduced broadcast hours; the loss of both Coca-Cola and AT&T as main sponsors of American Idol; and the closure of the American Idol Experience theme park attraction at Walt Disney World,” the company reported.

The bankruptcy filing was reported by The Hollywood Reporter.

In 2014, earnings from “American Idol” decreased by $15 million compared with the previous year, court papers said.

Core said total revenue declined by $35.6 million in the first half of 2015, compared with the first half of 2014.

Simon Fuller, the company’s former chief executive, who had been retained as a consultant, was listed as being owed $3.3 million, making him the largest unsecured creditor.
