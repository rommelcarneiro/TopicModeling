With the Obama administration nearing declassification of the still-secret 28 pages of a congressional report on the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, new worries have surfaced that the White House might hand Congress the responsibility for releasing the document, which is said to suggest high-level Saudi complicity in the episode.

That possibility has alarmed advocates for disclosing the pages, since there was no clear-cut avenue for Congress to do so. They had always assumed that the White House would act once it had completed its declassification review, and they now fear that involving Congress again is a stalling attack.

Hoping to clarify the situation, sponsors of the initial legislation calling for the release of the 28 pages introduced a separate House resolution on Wednesday urging the House Intelligence Committee to declassify the pages and publish them in the Congressional Record. The resolution, introduced by Representative Walter B. Jones, Republican of North Carolina, and others, says that “justice and truth must prevail over the embarrassment or protection of enemies of the American people that aided, abetted or materially assisted the gruesome international terrorist murders of 9/11.”

The resolution is a long shot, but advocates hope that it helps point a way for handling the pages once the intelligence community finishes its review, which could be in a matter of weeks.

“I have read these pages and can say that while their release will not harm national security, the contents are critical to our foreign policy moving forward,” Mr. Jones said.
