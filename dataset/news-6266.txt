Matt Harvey struck out 10 San Diego Padres on Sunday, the first time this season he has reached double figures in that category.

During the course of six innings, he looked dominant at times, but once again he had trouble in the middle of the game. He surrendered a two-run bomb in the bottom of the fifth inning to catcher Christian Bethancourt, who had just three career homers to that point, and only escaped that inning with a 3-2 lead when a tag play at home plate was generously called in favor of the Mets.

So what to make of Harvey’s seventh start of the season? He threw consistently harder than he had at any previous point this season, struck out the side in the first inning, gave up just four hits and two runs, and, shades of Bartolo Colon, hit a long drive of his own that almost went out of the park.

Still, when you pitch only six innings, as Harvey did Sunday, a lot of things can happen after you leave the game.

And in the case of the Mets, they only won the game — and moved back into first place in the National League East ahead of the Washington Nationals — because of the eighth-inning dominance of the left-handed reliever Antonio Bastardo.

So while this surely was Harvey’s best start of the season, and one that will leave everyone around the Mets encouraged, it still feels as if there is a ways to go for a pitcher who was fearsome for much of 2013 and reasonably tough in 2015 in his comeback from Tommy John surgery, but who has basically been a work in progress through the first chunk of the 2016 season.

It is worth noting, for instance, that Harvey has yet to pitch into the seventh inning this season. A year ago, he pitched at least seven innings in five of his first 10 starts in April and May.

Pitching only six innings — and Harvey has gone that far in only three of his seven starts — inevitably puts more pressure on the team’s relievers. And sure enough on Sunday, the Mets’ bullpen balked home a run in the seventh inning and appeared about to blow the game in the bottom of the eighth until Bastardo came in with the bases loaded and no outs and got two strikeouts and a pop-up to protect a 4-3 lead that Jeurys Familia closed out in the ninth.

Harvey is now 3-4 with an E.R.A. that is more than four runs a game. It is logical to think that he is still feeling the effects of his war-horse effort in 2015, when he ended up pitching 216 innings in the regular season and postseason.

That was more innings than anyone — most notably his agent, Scott Boras — wanted to see him throw after missing all of 2014, but the Mets were on a roll, eventually making it to the World Series, so it simply became almost unthinkable for him to sit down.

He did not. He even insisted on going out to pitch the ninth inning of Game 5 of the World Series against the better judgment of his manager, Terry Collins. Kansas City ended up tying the score in that inning and winning the Series a few innings later, and Harvey was left to brood about all of it during the off-season.

This season has not been any easier for him to deal with than that ninth inning was last November, but after Sunday’s game, in which he threw 102 pitches, Harvey was clearly upbeat, telling reporters that his mechanics were better, his command was better, everything was better.

Now he just needs to make it into the seventh inning, and then eventually the eighth. But maybe forget about the ninth.
