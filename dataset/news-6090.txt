Overtime is the ultimate crucible of basketball: five tense minutes, with the game potentially turning on every possession.

Stephen Curry on Monday scored more points in an overtime period than any other player in N.B.A. history. And he did it in the playoffs, after missing four games with a knee injury.

The signs were not initially auspicious. Curry was 2 for 13 from 3-point range in regulation after coming off the bench, and looked rusty.

Things improved late. Curry was 0 for his first 9 from distance, but then hit a long 3 with four and a half minutes left and had some good assists in the fourth quarter. He missed a running one-hander that would have won it in regulation, but Warriors fans had reason to hope he would be back in form for overtime.

Here’s what followed from Curry, who won his second consecutive M.V.P. award on Tuesday:

4:26 remaining: After a miss by C.J. McCollum for Portland, Curry brings the ball up. A pick by Festus Ezeli helps free him to drive for an easy 11-foot jump shot. The Warriors lead, 113-111, but Curry is far from done.

3:20: Al-Farouq Aminu and Mason Plumlee had scored for Portland, and the Warriors are down 3. That doesn’t last long. Curry makes a 3-pointer from near the top of the key to tie it at 116-116.

2:40: McCollum had put the Blazers back on top. Harrison Barnes misses, but Curry is right under the basket for a rebound and a quick put-back to tie the score at 118-118. Curry has averaged less than one offensive rebound a game throughout his career.

2:20: Draymond Green steals the ball from Damian Lillard, leading to an easy layup for Curry. The Warriors take a lead they will not relinquish, 120-118.

1:51: The killer. McCollum misses again, and Curry lopes down the court and bombs in a 26-foot pull-up jumper for 3. At this point, he has scored all 12 points for Golden State in the overtime. The score is 123-118.

1:05: After making just two 3-pointers in regulation, Curry hits his third of the five-minute overtime period, a 25-footer with Aminu in his face this time: 128-120.

The Blazers owner Paul Allen had a little trouble believing it:

52 seconds: Curry’s layup is blocked by Lillard. It is the only shot he misses in overtime. The score remains 128-120.

:18: Curry caps the record-setting 17-point performance with two free throws: 131-123. The previous record was held by Gilbert Arenas, who had 16 in a 60-point effort in the regular season for the Wizards against the Lakers in 2006.

Final score Monday night: 132-125, and the Warriors take a three-games-to-one lead back to California. Curry finished with 40 points.

Even Charles Barkley was not sure what to say:
