“God of Vengeance,” the 1920s Yiddish play that is currently the subject of the Off Broadway drama “Indecent,” will be revived in its original language by New Yiddish Rep for two performances this June.

Written by Sholem Asch, “God of Vengeance” is credited with presenting the first lesbian kiss on Broadway in 1923. It came under fire for its frank depictions of Jewish culture and homosexuality, and cast members were arrested on obscenity charges.

This year, the play has come into the spotlight again as the topic of Paula Vogel’s “Indecent,” which opened at the Vineyard Theater this month. “Indecent,’’ which is spoken in English, Yiddish and German, features excerpts from “God of Vengeance” as it follows the play from its inception through its world tour and tumultuous opening in New York. (Charles Isherwood named it a New York Times Critics’ Pick.)

New Yiddish Rep’s staged reading is to feature the entire text of the “God of Vengeance,” delivered in its original language, with English supertitles. Eleanor Reissa will direct and also act in the play. David Mandelbaum, the artistic director of New Yiddish Rep, will play a role as well.

The performances, June 25 and June 26, will be at the 14th Street Y as part of the Jewish Play Project’s OPEN: The Festival of New Jewish Theater.
