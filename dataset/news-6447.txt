Dancing about real estate is not uncommon in New York. Take Susan Rethorst’s “208 East Broadway,” a series inspired by her Lower East Side apartment (and her process of moving out); or Ellen Cornfield’s “Small Stages,” in which three dancers shared a platform the size of a walk-in closet.

The choreographer Juliette Mapp, who has been presenting work in New York since 2001, now turns to the subject of space with “Luxury Rentals,” which has its premiere on Thursday, May 12, at Danspace Project. The title calls to mind development in the surrounding East Village blocks while alluding to the greatest expense for many dancers: rehearsal space. But “Luxury Rentals” looks beyond the quantifiable (rent, square footage). With the eloquent dancers Levi Gonzalez, Jimena Paz and Kayvon Pourazar, Ms. Mapp explores how performers’ lives evolve with the city’s physical and financial terrain, suggesting that dancing, at whatever cost, may be the greatest luxury of all.
