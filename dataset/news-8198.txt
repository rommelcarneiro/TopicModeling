If you examine the signal moments of Afro-Latin music in New York since the mid-1970s, you’ll often find the trombonist Papo Vazquez in the picture, brash and precise, helping to drive the music, giving it snap and ferocity. When still a teenager, he played on Héctor Lavoe’s album “De Ti Depende,” which included the bitter masterpiece “Periodico de Ayer.” He worked with the Fania All-Stars, Jerry Gonzalez’s Fort Apache Band, Manny Oquendo’s Conjunto Libre, the great Puerto Rican band Batacumbele; he played in bands led by Hector Lavoe, Eddie Palmieri, Tito Puente and Chico O’Farrill; he was a member of Arturo O’Farrill’s groundbreaking Afro-Latin Jazz Orchestra in the aughts. But Mr. Vazquez’s work as a bandleader, pushing post-Coltrane jazz and Puerto Rican traditional rhythm to the front of a gnashing ensemble sound, deserves all the recognition it gets. On Saturday, April 30, a concert will recognize Mr. Vazquez’s 40 years on the scene, with his band Mighty Pirates Troubadours. (7:30 p.m., Hostos Center for the Arts and Culture Repertory Theater, 450 Grand Concourse, Bronx; hostoscenter.org.)
