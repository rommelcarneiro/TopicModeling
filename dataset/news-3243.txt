What makes for a good Style section story?

What constitutes a trend?

What is and isn’t fun about covering the “glittery people,” as Jacob Bernstein, a Style section feature reporter, has called them?

How do stories about George Clooney, Madonna (always gives a good quote), and Nicki Minaj (who, Jacob wrote, looked like “the incarnation of Jessica Rabbit” at the recent Met Gala) fit within The Times’s coverage, and what makes for a good Style section piece?

In this podcast, Jacob talks about Style, how he works the beat, and “Everything Is Copy,” the documentary he directed about his late mother, the writer Nora Ephron.

Susan Lehman is host.
