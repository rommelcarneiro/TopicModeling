The police clashed with demonstrators Wednesday outside a rally for Donald J. Trump in Anaheim, Calif., and made eight arrests, the city’s Police Department said.

Law enforcement authorities from at least three counties joined with Anaheim police officers in confronting about 200 demonstrators, some of whom threw bottles and rocks, said a police spokeswoman, Detective Laura Lomeli.

Seven people were arrested on charges of failing to respond to unlawful assembly warnings, she said. One person was charged with setting fire to a trash can. No one was injured, the detective said.

The Anaheim Police Department warned protesters in advance of the rally for Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, that there was “no room for violence in Anaheim.”

Photographs posted on Twitter showed police officers on horseback and motorcycles and in riot gear.

Detective Lomeli said protesters were largely cordoned off to the north side of Anaheim Convention Center, where the rally took place.

The detective said that there were still small groups of protesters several hours after Mr. Trump left, but that the crowd had mostly dispersed.

The police chief, Raul Quezada, said in a statement on the department’s website Wednesday that the police would be prepared to take “take swift and decisive enforcement action should it become necessary.”

“While we recognize and respect the First Amendment rights of all individuals to express their viewpoints and protest peacefully,” the chief said, “we will not tolerate violence or disobedience of the law during the upcoming rally in Anaheim.”

The clash between the police and demonstrators occurred one day after a similar confrontation between officers and anti-Trump protesters in Albuquerque.
