The major stock indexes retreated on Thursday after three days of gains as oil prices fell and global growth worries drove investors to safer assets like bonds.

Energy shares declined as crude oil prices also snapped a three-day streak of gains.

The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 19.86 points, or 0.11 percent, to 17,985.19, the S.&P. 500 lost 3.64 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,115.48, and the Nasdaq composite index dropped 16.03 points, or 0.32 percent, to 4,958.62.

The day’s losses were slight, and the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index is still near its record closing high of 2,130.82.

That record could fall in coming days, said Bruce Zaro, chief technical strategist at Bolton Global Asset Management in Boston.

“I would expect some follow-through in the next days and weeks,” he said.

Among the stocks to gain was J. M. Smucker, which reported that its quarterly net sales jumped 25 percent, beating analysts’ estimates, as demand rose for its Folgers and Dunkin’ Donuts branded coffee and its pet foods. The company’s stock rose nearly 8 percent to close $143.23 a share.

Federal Reserve officials meet next Tuesday and Wednesday, and are expected to leave rates unchanged.

In the bond market, United States Treasury yields dipped to 3 1/2 month lows as falling oil and stock prices led investors to seek safe-haven debt.

Benchmark 10-year notes gained 8/32 in price to yield 1.68 percent, the lowest since Feb. 24.

Brent crude fell 56 cents, or 1.07 percent, at $51.95 a barrel, while crude prices fell 67 cents, or 1.31 percent, at $50.56 in New York.

“So far this looks like a modest technical correction following three days of gains, rather than a major reversal,” said Tim Evans, energy futures specialist at Citi Futures in New York.

Shares of Exxon Mobil fell 12 cents to $90.67, while Chevron shares were down 28 cents to $102.81.

The yen, which investors prefer in times of market uncertainty, reached a three-year peak against the euro and a five-week high versus the dollar. But late in the session, the Japanese currency fell marginally against the dollar.

“It’s generally a cautious mood today. You have stocks lower and yields lower,” said Eric Viloria, currency strategist at Wells Fargo Securities in New York.

The dollar was supported by an unexpected drop in jobless claims and a stronger-than-expected rise in wholesale sales in April. The data soothed some concerns about the economy decelerating in the second quarter.

Europe’s broad FTSEurofirst 300 index closed down 0.94 percent at 1,340.20. Stocks were hurt by weaker commodities-related shares and comments from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi that Europe is at risk of suffering lasting economic damage from weak productivity and low growth.
