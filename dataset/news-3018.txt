DUBLIN, Ohio — Matt Kuchar finished the third round of the Memorial with a share of the lead, just as he had started it on Saturday.

But it was a wet and wild ride for Kuchar and everyone else at Muirfield Village, where play was suspended for a time in the evening.

Kuchar fell off the pace quickly with two bogeys only to surge back into the lead with four birdies and two par saves in a six-hole stretch.

A bogey on the final hole gave Kuchar a two-under 70 and a share of the lead with William McGirt and Gary Woodland.

McGirt shot an eight-under 64 to surge up the leader board. Woodland shot 69.

Twenty players were separated by four shots going into Sunday’s final round.

Jason Day was in contention for the lead until he had a double bogey on the final hole for a 68. He still was only three shots behind and Rory McIlroy was five back.

The final group finished play around 8 p.m.
