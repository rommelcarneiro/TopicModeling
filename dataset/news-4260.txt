Brevity, it seems, is no longer the soul of Twitter.

The social media company said on Tuesday that in the coming months it would peel away some of the limitations of its 140-character-per-post rule.

This news, depending on whether you are a Twitter-must-never-change die-hard or a pragmatist, is either the worst thing to happen in the not-so-long history of social media or the natural evolution of a company trying to find a bigger audience.

Under the new changes, tagging users by their handles at the beginning of replies and adding photos, GIFs and videos will no longer count against the 140-character limit, Mike Isaac reports.

Sadly, there is still no limit to the number of tweets in a “tweetstorm.”

While the change announced on Tuesday is sure to rankle some veteran Twitter users, the company may have to loosen its tweet doctrine to attract users who may be confused by the social media service’s quirky protocols.

Last month, Twitter said it had an average of 310 million monthly users in the first three months of 2016, up from 305 million users in the last three months of 2015. That number has been inching forward far more slowly than anyone associated with the company would like.

Change at Twitter may not be welcomed by everyone. But it appears to be necessary.
