Rebuilding America PAC, one of the new “super PACs” that recently sprouted in support of Donald J. Trump, has made its first advertising buy of the general election campaign, reserving roughly $1.1 million on national cable outlets, according to two strategists with knowledge of the purchase.

The group, which released its first ad over the weekend tying Hillary Clinton’s use of her private email to her husband’s past scandals, is being backed by Tom Barrack, a real estate developer and an old friend of Mr. Trump. The group recently hired Alex Castellanos, a Republican strategist and ad maker.

Mr. Barrack said that the group had raised $32 million, but it has not yet filed its fund-raising report with the Federal Election Commission.

The initial ad purchase is the first step in the group’s plan to counter an advertising blitz of more than $90 million planned by Priorities USA Action, the super PAC supporting Hillary Clinton.

It also is the first time Mr. Trump’s candidacy will be supported in a significant ad campaign since he became the presumptive Republican nominee. Another group, Great America PAC, has been running advertisements on select DirecTV and Dish services, but has also focused more on push polling and fund-raising ads.

The ad is currently slotted to run only from June 9 through June 16, but that period could be extended

Previously, Mr. Trump had eschewed any support of super PACs, telling groups supporting him last year to return any donations to donors. A major theme of his campaign for the Republican nomination was a pledge to “self-fund” his bid to show he couldn’t be bought by the wealthy donors who pour millions of dollars into super PACs.

But as his campaign has slowly made the transition toward the general election, numerous super PACs have sprung up in support of the candidate, and he hasn’t made any effort to quash their existence. There are currently at least four super PACs set up to help Mr. Trump win the general election.
