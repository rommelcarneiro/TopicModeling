The Paris-based jeweler Alessandro Sabbatini insists he doesnâ€™t search for materials to realize the one-of-a-kind pieces he dreams up for his two-year-old line called Sabba. (He makes fewer than 40 pieces a year.) Instead, he says, they find him. After months of staring at a Victorian necklace of graduated amber beads that called out to the 28-year-old from an antique shop, inspiration struck. It is now a towering pair of earrings resembling a dangling Chinese temple. Fashioned with a series of delicate but complex titanium armatures, the pieces are hinged with elongated diamond baguettes, much like a string of twinkling paper lanterns.
