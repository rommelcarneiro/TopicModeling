PORTLAND, Ore. — Thomas McNamara scored in the 65th minute to give New York City F.C. a 2-1 victory over the Portland Timbers on Sunday.

McNamara’s 20-yard shot curled around goalkeeper Jake Gleeson and into the upper corner of the net for his third goal of the season.

N.Y.C.F.C. took the lead in the 12th minute under disputed circumstances. Defender R. J. Allen appeared to use his hands to knock the ball away from Darlington Nagbe, but no foul was called. Instead, Allen sent an inch-perfect 30-yard rolling pass into the path of David Villa, who calmly shot the ball past Gleeson for his eighth goal of the season.

Portland tied it in the 55th minute when Fanendo Adi fended off a defender and muscled his way into the N.Y.C.F.C. penalty area. His shot deflected off a defender and beat goalkeeper Josh Saunders. It was Adi’s eighth goal of the season, tying him for the league lead with Villa and Sebastian Giovinco of Toronto.

N.Y.C.F.C. (4-3-4) has won three straight, tied for the longest in the team’s short history, and moved into a tie for first place in the Eastern Conference with Montreal, at 16 points.

Portland, the defending M.L.S. Cup champion, continues to struggle early in the season. The Timbers (3-6-3) have lost three in a row and sit second from the bottom in the Western Conference with 12 points.
