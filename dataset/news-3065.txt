Karen Adele Sendler, the daughter of David A. Sendler of Naples, Fla., and the late Emily I. Sendler was married June 4 to John Kenneth Kirkwood, the son of Kenneth W. Kirkwood and Carol L. Kirkwood of Haddonfield, N.J. Charles L. Burgess, a friend of the couple who became a Universal Life minister for the occasion, officiated at the home of the groom’s parents.

The ceremony incorporated Jewish and Scottish elements, including breaking the glass inside a bag made from the groom’s Wallace family tartan, the bride’s father wore a tie made from the Jewish tartan, and there was a bagpiper playing “Hava Nagila.”

The couple graduated from Columbia.

The bride, 43, who will continue to use her name professionally, works in New York as the director of alumni relations and special programs at Cambridge in America, an organization that supports Cambridge University in fund-raising and alumni relations in the United States.

Her father is the editor in chief of Gulfshore Life, a magazine in Naples, published by Open Sky Media. Her mother was the founder of Victoria's Hope Chest in Rosemont, Pa., which created handmade quilts.

The groom, 45, owns CityMouse in New York, which helps people with cognitive disabilities and older adults use the web. He is on the board of the Brain Injury Association of New York State in Albany.

His mother is an artist whose oil portraits were part of a group show in 2014 at the Markeim Arts Center in Haddonfield. His father, who is retired, was the senior project manager on the construction of a power plant in Hanoi, Vietnam, for the engineering firm Stone & Webster.

The couple met in December 2007 in Mr. Kirkwood’s bedroom in New York. A mutual friend, who had flown in from Hanoi, was using the bedroom as a staging area for a debut trunk show of men’s shirts, and Ms. Sendler had been enlisted to iron and fold shirts on Mr. Kirkwood’s bed.
