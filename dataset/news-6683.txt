Stocks closed mostly unchanged on Thursday after an early rally in oil prices faded. Investors were awaiting the release of a closely watched jobs report on Friday.

The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 0.49 of a point, less than 0.1 percent, to 2,050.63, and the Nasdaq composite lost 8.55 points, or 0.2 percent, to 4,717.09.

The Dow Jones industrial average rose 9.45 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 17,660.71.

As the week drew to a close, the market’s focus turned to the April jobs report. Investors will be watching closely to see how it influences the Federal Reserve’s plans for raising interest rates at its next policy meeting in June.

Economists expect the labor report to show the number of nonfarm jobs grew by 200,000 last month and the unemployment rate stayed at or slightly under 5 percent.

A private sector jobs report released by ADP on Wednesday showed that private employers created only 156,000 jobs last month, significantly below estimates.

Ahead of Friday’s numbers, investors were reluctant to make any bets. Several traders and strategists said there was no major catalyst to move the market higher at the moment.

“There’s just too many unknowns right now, and there’s nothing to get people going in the market. The jobs numbers may provide some guidance,” said JJ Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade.

Crude oil prices gave up much of an early gain that was driven by concerns that production could be reduced by a fire that swept through the Canadian oil sands hub of Fort McMurray, Alberta.

Benchmark American crude oil rose 54 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $44.32 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, used to price international oils, was up 58 cents, or 1.3 percent, at $45.20 a barrel in London. Oil had been up nearly 4 percent earlier in the day.

Despite what turned out to be a relatively modest rise in oil prices, energy companies were still the best-performing part of the market. The energy component of the S.&P. 500 rose 0.7 percent.

A number of companies fell after earnings and forecasts that did not impress investors. The electric carmaker Tesla sank $11.03, or 5 percent, to $211.53 after reporting a much wider loss than Wall Street analysts were expecting. The company suffered parts delays for its new Model X S.U.V.

The cereal maker Kellogg sank $1.97, or 2.6 percent, to $75.05 after reporting declines in both sales and earnings in the first quarter. SeaWorld Entertainment sank 98 cents, or 5 percent, to $18.49 after reporting a wider first-quarter loss as expenses climbed.

In other energy commodities, wholesale gasoline rose less than 1 cent, to $1.49 a gallon; heating oil was unchanged at $1.33; and natural gas fell 7 cents, to $2.076 per thousand cubic feet.

Bond prices rose, sending yields lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.74 percent from 1.78 percent a day earlier. The euro fell to $1.1400 from $1.1489 and the dollar rose to 107.24 yen from 106.90 yen.

In metals, gold fell $2.10, to $1,272.30 an ounce; silver rose 3 cents, to $17.33 an ounce; and copper fell 3 cents, to $2.15 a pound.
