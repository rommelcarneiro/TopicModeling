Look, I don’t know why Alex is denying Luna catnip any more than I understand the beard licking. That said, there are no adverse affects to occasional ’nip-dosing. Lots of cats actually feel no intoxicating effect at all (supporting my long-held theory: Lots of cats are fakers). But let me ask: Do you clean Luna’s litter box? No? Then shut up. P.S.: How do you know Luna wants to experiment unless you’ve offered her a hit, or have done so much catnip yourself that you think you speak cat. Either way, get clean, dude.
