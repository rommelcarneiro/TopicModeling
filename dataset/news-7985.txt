Taste Makers is a documentary series exploring the challenges facing young people in America who aspire to careers as chefs, farmers and food-industry entrepreneurs. The subjects are ambitious and driven, but their futures are by no means clear or assured. They stand alone, and move forward on their dreams.

For this episode, we visit with Adrienne Cheatham, 34, a trained dancer and former cook at Le Bernardin, who at the time of our filming was working as the chef de cuisine at the celebrity chef Marcus Samuelsson’s Red Rooster restaurant in Harlem.

Ms. Cheatham labors to explore her own identity as a chef while at the same time executing Mr. Samuelsson’s hits in the restaurant’s kitchen, six days a week, usually for 12 to 16 hours a day. In the background are her own desires: to have her own restaurant, to continue dancing, to move forward with success. She has since been promoted to executive chef.

Of course we asked her for a recipe. She gave us a fine one for beer-brined roast chicken.
