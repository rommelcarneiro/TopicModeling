Good evening. Here’s the latest.

1. President Obama told an enthusiastic audience in Vietnam that “big nations should not bully smaller ones,” a supportive reference to Vietnam’s disputes with China. But several activists were barred from meeting him, a reminder of the tensions over human rights between the U.S. and Vietnam’s authoritarian government.

2. The presidential race has revealed so many party fractures that the Republican leadership is considering fundamental changes to the nomination process — even possibly demoting the status of Iowa and New Hampshire. A growing number of Bernie Sanders’s supporters say they would vote for Donald Trump rather than Hillary Clinton, deepening her challenge. And one of our columnists suggests that Mr. Trump’s rise may be best understood as part of an international backlash against global economic trends that enrich only some.

3. Five months of lawyers’ arguments could not persuade a Pennsylvania judge to drop sexual assault charges against Bill Cosby. “This case will move forward,” the judge told a crowded courtroom. A number of women have accused the 78-year-old entertainer of sexual assault, but this case involves just one: a former Temple University staff member for whom he was a mentor, who says he drugged her to have sex with her.

_____

4. More evidence for those arguing for prison reform: The Justice Department’s inspector general said that, in one six-year period, more than 4,300 people were held in federal prisons beyond their release dates. The report cited avoidable staff errors by prison officials, like failing to give the inmates credit for time served before the sentencing or misinterpreting the terms of the sentences.

_____

5. Canada is finally investigating “The Highway of Tears,” where dozens of young women and girls — most of them indigenous — have gone missing or been murdered over the last 30 years. One advocate said, “When it comes to the missing, racism runs deep.”

_____

6. Analysts said the U.S. strike that killed the Taliban’s leader may have been meant as a message to Pakistan. Senior Taliban leaders, apparently shocked that Pakistani protection failed, are debating who should take overall command. Above, Pakistanis protest the strike.

_____

7. An unusual critic says he thinks NASA’s estimates of the size of asteroids — some of which could hit Earth someday — are “all basically wrong.” He’s not an astronomer. He’s Nathan Myhrvold, the former chief technologist at Microsoft and the author of a six-volume series on cooking.

_____

8. The Golden State Warriors fell to the Oklahoma City Thunder, 118-94, in Tuesday’s N.B.A. playoff game. Despite a record-setting season, the Warriors are now down, 3-1, in their series with the Thunder and face elimination at home on Thursday.

_____

9. Twitter is about to get a little more verbose. Within a few months, these things will no longer count against the social media service’s 140-character limit: user handles at the beginning of replies, photos, GIFs and videos. One analyst saluted the changes as an effort to respond to users’ needs and turn the company around.

_____

10. Broadway is breaking records again. “The Lion King,” now more than 18 years old, grossed $102.7 million last season, far outpacing any other show. Worldwide, it has grossed more than $6.2 billion, and it has been seen by 85 million people. “Hamilton” added a huge burst of energy and made $74 million but ranked fifth in box office, behind “Wicked,” “Aladdin” and “The Book of Mormon.”

_____

11. Finally, interesting news about our tentacled friends in the deep. Even as many fish populations are in decline, cuttlefish, squid and octopus are thriving. One expert thinks that climate change and overfishing may be creating uniquely advantageous conditions for cephalopods.
