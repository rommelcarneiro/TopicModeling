Barbaralee Diamonstein-Spielvogel, an author, preservationist and curator, was appointed chairwoman of the New York State Council on the Arts this week.

Currently the council’s vice president, Dr. Diamonstein-Spielvogel, who holds a Ph.D., said in a telephone interview that one of her goals as chairwoman was to expand “meaningful engagement with the more diverse communities of New York,” outside New York City, where there are fewer resources.

She said, however, that she did not intend to “neglect the major institutions throughout the state.” She said she would begin her duties in the coming week with a meeting of the council’s staff.

Dr. Diamonstein-Spielvogel has a history of having led city, state and federal councils and commissions on the arts, landmarks, museums, and other civic and cultural assets, including serving as the first director of the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs in 1966.

“Barbaralee has dedicated her career to preserving and enriching cultural life across the state and across the nation,” Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said of her appointment in a statement on Monday. “She is a leader whose knowledge, wide experience and energy will help shape our vision for cultural development and advance the future of the arts in New York.”

The council awards about 1,900 grants each year that range from $2,500 to $135,000, to nonprofit arts organizations in the state. The recommendation for funding the agency in the next fiscal year is $46.9 million.
