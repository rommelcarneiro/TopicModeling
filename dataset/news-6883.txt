What is a conservatorship?

When someone is thought to be unable to care for himself or herself, an adult with a relationship to the individual, perhaps a spouse or other relative, may petition a county probate court for control over his or her affairs via a conservatorship. (In some states, it is known as a guardianship.) This can include control over his or her personal needs (physical health, food, shelter), financial affairs or both.

Who oversees a conservatorship?

A court-appointed lawyer is assigned to ensure that conservators are not taking advantage of their power or inappropriately restricting the freedoms of the person being cared for. For Ms. Spears, that person is Samuel D. Ingham III, who also worked on Mr. Kasem’s conservatorship. In a general conservatorship, a court investigator also files progress reports every other year.

How could a conservatorship end?

If the person under the conservatorship becomes able to handle his or her affairs, someone involved or close to the case would have to ask the court to end the arrangement. The court investigator would then look into the case, and a judge would ultimately decide. The court can also remove a conservator who isn’t fulfilling his or her duties.
