United States markets fell on Friday as a drop in oil prices took shares of energy companies sharply lower. Banks were falling again as bond yields continued to shrink. The losses wiped out most of the market’s gains from earlier this week.

KEEPING SCORE At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 0.67 percent and the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was down 0.92 percent. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 1.29 percent.

The S.&P. 500 reached an 11-month high this week and so did oil prices, but investors remained cautious as they looked to a Federal Reserve meeting next week and Britain’s referendum on its membership in the European Union on June 23.

ENERGY United States crude oil shed $1.49 to $49.07 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil prices, fell $1.41, or 2.71 percent, at $50.54 a barrel.

ConocoPhillips shares gave up 4.4 percent and shares of the oil field services company Schlumberger declined 1.8 percent. Chevron stock fell 0.8 percent.

BANKS STUMBLE As they did on Thursday, bank stocks fell along with bond yields. Lower bond yields drive down the interest rates on mortgages and other kinds of loans, and that makes them less profitable for banks. Citigroup shares sank 2.5 percent, and shares of JPMorgan Chase lost 1.4 percent. Bank of America stock fell 2.5 percent.

Bond prices rose further, and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note sank to 1.64 percent from 1.69 percent.

The drop in bond yields sent shares of phone companies higher, as those stocks’ high dividend yields are comparable to bonds. Verizon Communications shares rose 1.4 percent.

DRUG PRICE DOUBTS Drug company stocks fell further. Mylan shares lost 2.7 percent after David Maris, an analyst at Wells Fargo, said the company might come under scrutiny from regulators because it made some “exceptionally large price increases” on its drugs this year. Mr. Maris said the price changes might also indicate that some of Mylan’s other products were not selling as well as it had hoped.

A number of drug companies’ shares have tumbled in recent months as regulators questioned their patterns of raising prices and other business practices. Shares of Endo International, which has plunged more than 70 percent this year, fell 8.4 percent.

CONSUMER WOES Consumer stocks also fell, with some of the sharpest losses going to big names. Shares of Amazon declined 1.34 percent, and Netflix stock dropped 3.44 percent.

OUTFITTERS FALLS Shares of the retailer Urban Outfitters slumped after the company said that sales at established stores had continued to fall in the second quarter so far. Those sales are considered an important measurement of retailer performance. The company’s stock slid 5.8 percent.

BLOOD TEST Shares of Global Blood Therapeutics climbed after the company reported positive results from an early clinical study of its most advanced drug, a potential treatment for sickle cell disease. The company’s stock gained 9 percent.

CHEMICAL DEAL The ethylene producer Westlake Chemical said it would buy the chemical maker Axiall for $33 a share, or $2.33 billion. That was a 28 percent premium to the price of Axiall shares on Thursday. Axiall stock jumped 26 percent and shares of Westlake rose 2.77 percent.

BLOCK RISES The tax preparer H&R Block posted a bigger profit and more revenue than analysts had expected, sending its stock up 12.4 percent.

TOSSING AND TURNING Mattress Firm Holding Corp., the bedding maker behind Serta, Sealy, and other brands, reported a bigger loss and less revenue than expected and cut its estimates for the year. Its stock dropped 12.5 percent.

EUROPEAN MARKETS In Germany, the DAX tumbled 2.5 percent, and in France, the CAC 40 lost 2.2 percent. The FTSE 100 slid 1.9 percent in Britain.

ASIA’S DAY The Nikkei 225 declined 0.4 percent in Japan, while the Kospi slipped 0.3 percent in South Korea. The Hang Seng shed 1.2 percent in Hong Kong. In Australia, the S.&P./ASX 200 lost 0.9 percent. Benchmarks in Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand also fell. Markets were closed in mainland China and Taiwan for a holiday.

CURRENCIES The dollar rose to 106.85 yen from 106.83 yen late Thursday. The euro fell to $1.1257 from $1.1331.
