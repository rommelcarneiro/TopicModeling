LONDON — The French drug company Sanofi and Medivation, a California company that makes a prostate cancer drug, traded volleys on Thursday in a contentious takeover fight.

Medivation reiterated its rejection of Sanofi’s $9.3 billion offer, calling the proposal “inadequate.”

“Medivation’s board of directors believes the execution of Medivation’s business plan will deliver value to its stockholders that is far superior to Sanofi’s proposal,” the company said in a news release.

Earlier in the day, in a letter to Medivation’s board that Sanofi made public, Sanofi said that it had had “extensive conversations” with Medivation’s top shareholders and thought there was “overwhelming support” for a transaction.

Sanofi said it would go directly to Medivation’s shareholders if the company’s board continued to decline to negotiate on a transaction.

“As you know, your shareholders have the ability to act at any time by written consent to remove and replace the board,” Olivier Brandicourt, the Sanofi chief executive, said in the letter. “If the Medivation board of directors continues to refuse to engage with us, then we intend to commence a process to remove and replace members of the board.”

On April 28, Sanofi offered to acquire Medivation, the maker of the prostate cancer therapy Xtandi, for $52.50 a share.

The offer represented a premium of more than 50 percent over Medivation’s two-month volume-weighted average share price before takeover rumors emerged, but it was less than 1 percent above its closing price on April 27.

Last week, David Hung, a founder and the president and chief executive of Medivation, called Sanofi’s proposal “opportunistically timed” and said it “substantially undervalues” the company. Medivation’s directors unanimously rejected the offer.

Shares of Medivation have risen since the offer was made on speculation that another bidder might step in or Sanofi might increase its offer. The company’s shares rose 1 percent in midday trading on Thursday, to $59.65. Medivation was scheduled to release its first-quarter earnings on Thursday after the markets closed.

“I want to reiterate our preference to engage with you to negotiate a transaction,” Mr. Brandicourt said in the letter. “We believe immediate engagement would be in the best interests of your shareholders as it would enable them promptly to realize substantial and certain value, while minimizing the disruption to your organization.”

Mr. Brandicourt, who took over as chief executive last year after Christopher A. Viehbacher was ousted, has said that Sanofi is interested in medium-size acquisitions and that cancer treatment is an area of interest.
