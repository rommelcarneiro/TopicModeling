The Blackstone Group, the private equity giant, suffered a sharp 77 percent decline in its net income for the first quarter, as volatile market conditions kept the firm from unloading assets and cashing in rich performance fees.

The results that were announced on Thursday did not come as a surprise. Last year was one of the most profitable years in Blackstone’s history, driven in large part by bountiful performance fees, so investors had expected the company’s results in 2016 to offer a poor annual comparison.

Economic net income for the first quarter came in at $370.7 million, down from $1.62 billion a year earlier.

Still, the precipitous profit drop is a reminder why Blackstone’s share price continues to trade at a noticeable discount — despite the loud efforts of its chief executive, Stephen A. Schwarzman — to asset management companies like BlackRock and T. Rowe Price, which do not see such sharp profit swings.

The uncertain market environment did not keep the firm from raking in money though. Assets under management, the most crucial gauge for an investment manager, rose 11 percent in the first quarter, compared with the quarter a year earlier, to $343.7 billion, by far the most under management of any alternative investment company. Blackstone attracted $17 billion for the quarter and an impressive $80 billion over the last year.

“Global investors continue to turn to the alternatives asset class, and Blackstone in particular, to provide superior long-term investment performance in a challenging and uncertain environment,” Mr. Schwarzman said in a statement.

The persistent increase in assets under management highlight Blackstone’s most crucial competitive advantage: its ability to keep attracting new funds and lock in the money it does have for as long as 10 years. Most other asset management firms have suffered outflows as skittish investors have withdrawn funds.

Over time, Blackstone has been able to invest these funds in lucrative private equity and real estate deals and when the company sells these stakes in the markets it can collect some of the highest performance fees in the industry.

The firm reported profit declines in all its market segments, with private equity dropping 89 percent and real estate down 64 percent. Hedge fund profits fell by 59 percent and credit profits fell 65 percent; the units are smaller profit contributors.
