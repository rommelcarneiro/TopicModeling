Phillipa Soo, currently starring in “Hamilton” on Broadway, will leave the show and take the title role in a musical adaptation of the film “Amélie.”

“Amélie,” which began its life at Berkeley Repertory Theater in California last year, is scheduled to have a second production this winter at the Ahmanson Theater in Los Angeles, and then to come to Broadway next year. Like the 2001 film on which it is based, it is a romantic comedy about an altruistic waitress in Paris.

The show, directed by Pam MacKinnon (a Tony winner for “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?”), features a book by Craig Lucas (“An American in Paris”), music by Daniel Messé (of the band Hem) and lyrics by Mr. Messé and Nathan Tysen (“Tuck Everlasting”).

Ms. Soo played Amélie in initial workshops for the musical; in Berkeley, Samantha Barks played the role.

Ms. Soo’s performance as Eliza Hamilton in “Hamilton” is her Broadway debut, and she was nominated for a Tony Award for the role. She is expected to leave the cast of “Hamilton” on July 9, the same date that Lin-Manuel Miranda is departing. Her casting in “Amélie” was previously reported by The Daily News.
