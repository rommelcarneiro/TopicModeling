A Norwegian consumers’ group produced a 32-hour webcast of a team of readers going through the fine print of terms and conditions of downloadable apps.

Finn Myrstad of the Norwegian Consumer Council, a government agency, said the idea was to point out the absurdity and possible illegality of some of the conditions.

“We got the idea from slow TV,” he told The Associated Press, referring to broadcasts in Norway of, for instance, five straight hours of knitting, a fire burning itself out and live, minute-by-minute salmon fishing.

Mr. Myrstad said that the team decided to read and analyze the small print of selected apps over six months, and that it discovered that many of them broke the law.

“We wanted to expose the absurdity of the terms and conditions of when you download an app,” he said. “You usually don’t read them because they’re either too long or complicated, and many of them breach consumer law and data protection laws.”

The webcast began Tuesday morning, when the team started reading the terms of around 30 popular apps. It ended 32 hours later. The council later tweeted a 12-second recap of the broadcast.
