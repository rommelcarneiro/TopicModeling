WASHINGTON — Doctors who prescribe painkillers should be required to undergo training aimed at reducing misuse and abuse of the medications, said a group of advisers to the Food and Drug Administration, though they acknowledge the challenge of putting such a mandate in place.

The agency’s advisers voted unanimously on Wednesday that the F.D.A. should change its so-called risk-management programs for opioid painkillers, the highly addictive medications at the center of a national wave of addiction and abuse.

Opioids are among the most widely prescribed drugs in the nation, with more than 170 million prescriptions filled last year.

Panelists also said the risk plans should apply to all prescription painkillers, including immediate-release drugs such as Vicodin and Percocet. As it stands, such measures apply only to long-acting drugs that release their ingredients over 12 hours or more, like OxyContin.

The F.D.A. is not required to follow the advice of its panelists, though it often does.

It is the second time since 2010 that an F.D.A. panel has recommended expanding safety measures for painkillers. But the training plans instituted about four years ago are voluntary, and data shows that under half of the doctors targeted by the effort have completed the training.

Despite a full day of presentations, many panelists said they still could not determine whether the risk plans had helped curb misuse and abuse of the drugs.

While overall painkiller prescriptions have fallen slightly over the last five years, that trend began before the safety programs were in effect. At the same time, overdose deaths tracked by federal scientists have continued to rise.

“The data does not give us a clear indication of whether we are reaching the target population for the crisis we are trying to resolve,” said Joseph O’Brien, the panel’s patient representative.
