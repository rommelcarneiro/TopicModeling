W Hotels Worldwide already hires D.J.s to spin in its lobbies, and stages live performances. Now it aims to expand its appeal to musicians and their fans by installing music recording studios known as Sound Suites in select locations.

The first made its debut today at the W Bali – Seminyak in Indonesia. The roughly 600-square-foot sound-insulated studio includes a vocal booth and is available to touring musicians, local artists and guests looking to lay down a few tracks with friends for about $150 for four hours. The company plans to offer studio space for free to some local artists.

“It gives us that extra step of being part of the music community and building relationships with future performers,” said Anthony Ingham, W’s global brand leader.

The hotel group plans to install Sound Suites at W hotels in Hollywood, Barcelona and Seattle later this year. It also plans to launch a three-day music festival in the fall at its W Scottsdale hotel in Arizona, turning its indoor and outdoor spaces into intimate stages for a range of artists from acoustic to electronic.
