For pure escapism, nothing is quite like running away to the circus, and with the annual spring flurry of Broadway openings in the rearview mirror, now seems a perfect time for just such a change of pace. You’ll need to go only as far as Brooklyn, where next door to St. Ann’s Warehouse a temporary big top has been constructed under the Brooklyn Bridge. There, for the next few weeks, NoFit State Circus, a company that hails from Cardiff, Wales, will be in residence with “Bianco,” an immersive circus performance.

Audience members will stand while trapeze artists fly above their heads and other performers interact with them below in the show, which drew crowds at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 2013 and 2014. The St. Ann’s visit is the North American debut of this talented troupe. Through May 29, St. Ann’s Warehouse, 718-254-8779; stannswarehouse.org.
