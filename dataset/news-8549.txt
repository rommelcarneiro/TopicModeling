Google’s regulatory issues in Europe have gotten more complicated.

As expected, European officials on Wednesday charged the giant search company with breaking the region’s competition rules. This time, the charges were aimed at Google’s mobile business, specifically that the company unfairly promotes some of its own services — like its mobile search — on its widely used Android mobile software over those of its competitors, Mark Scott writes.

It is the second set of antitrust charges by European regulators against Google in consecutive years. Last year, the region’s antitrust authorities accused the company of favoring some of its search services over those of rivals. A decision on those charges is expected in the coming months.

The new statement of objections on Wednesday highlights once again how Europe has far and away become the most aggressive region in using regulation to try to rein in Google.

The efforts do not always work. In the area of privacy, for instance, Europe passed a law nearly two years ago called “right to be forgotten” that lets individuals petition companies like Google to have search links about themselves removed. In a strange twist, that law has now enabled Google to become the region’s most active adjudicator of privacy cases.
