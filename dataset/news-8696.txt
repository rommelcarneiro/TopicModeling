It’s no surprise that organic produce, artisanal cheeses and grass-fed meats are infiltrating the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Bedford-Stuyvesant and Bushwick. The latest is Chicky’s, established by Tara Oxley, who owns the restaurant Eugene & Company just down the block. Products and ingredients come from Murray’s Cheese, DeBragga meats and Greenpoint Fish & Lobster Company. Prepared food to take home is made by Jeff Shields, the chef at Eugene & Company: Chicky’s, 406 Tompkins Avenue (Hancock Street), Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, 718-975-7646.
