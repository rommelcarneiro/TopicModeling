The pianist Taka Kigawa has demonstrated insightful musicianship and impressive stamina during myriad marathon performances at Le Poisson Rouge, including Pierre Boulez’s complete works for solo piano and Bach’s “The Art of Fugue.” On Monday, May 16, he tackles another major work: the 18 pieces of Ligeti’s complete Piano Études. Ligeti was inspired by Chopin, Liszt, Debussy, jazz and the complex polyphony of sub-Saharan African music while writing his series of rhythmically complicated and virtuosic character pieces.

Also on Monday, for one of the Miller Theater’s informal Pop-Up concerts, the cellist Michael Nicolas will explore works that pair cello with electronics and computer. The program includes music by Annie Gosfield, Mario Davidovsky, John Zorn, David Fulmer and Jaime E. Oliver, who will accompany Mr. Nicolas on an electronic instrument called the MANO controller.
