Kevin Molino scored in extra time Sunday to give Orlando City a 2-2 tie with New York City F.C. at Yankee Stadium.

Molino put away a header from the center of the box in the 94th minute to extend Orlando City’s unbeaten streak to three games. Carlos Rivas fired a cross to the far post that Cyle Larin centered to set up Molino’s sixth goal of the season.

Frederic Brillant scored his first career M.L.S. goal in the 42nd minute, and David Villa chipped in from the center of the box to give New York City a 2-0 lead in the 66th.

Julio Baptista, off a feed from Molino, rolled a right-footed kick past N.Y.C.F.C. goalkeeper Josh Saunders into the bottom-left corner — Baptista’s first M.L.S. goal — to put Orlando City (3-3-7) within striking distance about six minutes later.

New York City F.C. (4-4-6) is winless in its past two matches after having gone unbeaten in its previous five.
