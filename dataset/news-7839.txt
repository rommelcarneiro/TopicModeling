Film buffs soon will have a new viewing option for contemporary and classic movies with the start of a streaming service called FilmStruck this fall.

Developed by Turner Classic Movies in partnership with Criterion Collection, the new subscription-based service will feature hundreds of films from independent and major Hollywood studios. Those include “Seven Samurai,” “Breaker Morant,” “Blood Simple” and “Mad Max.”

FilmStruck also will be the exclusive streaming destination for Criterion Collection, which specializes in licensing classic and contemporary films. Criterion will operate a channel on the service to spotlight more than 1,000 films and other content such as commentary on films and filmmakers.

The service will be advertising free. Specific pricing details are still being determined.

“FilmStruck is a terrific example of our strategy to meet consumer demand for great content across all screens,” John Martin, chief executive of Turner, said in a statement. “It’s tailor-made for the die-hard movie enthusiast that crave a deep, intimate experience with independent, foreign, and art house films. And it takes advantage of TCM’s powerful curation capabilities as well as its proven track record of building a long-term relationship with passionate film fans.”
