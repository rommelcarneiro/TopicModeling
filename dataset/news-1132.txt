The main “super PAC” supporting Hillary Clinton raised $12.1 million in May, the group said on Monday — its largest haul of the year as Mrs. Clinton shifts from the Democratic presidential primary to a likely showdown with Donald J. Trump in the fall.

The group, Priorities USA Action, said it had entered June with over $50 million in cash on hand after securing more than $130 million in donations and commitments during the election cycle to date.

Priorities USA Action has reserved about $147 million in television, radio and digital platform spending across eight states: Ohio, Florida, Virginia, Nevada, Colorado, North Carolina, Iowa and New Hampshire.

“In the last few weeks Donald Trump accused President Obama of working with ISIS, took a victory lap following a national tragedy and mimed shooting someone at one of his events,” Guy Cecil, the group’s chief strategist, said in a statement, using an acronym for the Islamic State. “Priorities USA is not going to let this man anywhere near the White House because he is far too dangerous and divisive to ever be president of the United States.”

The efforts highlight the significant fund-raising and organizational advantages Mrs. Clinton and her allies enjoy against supporters of Mr. Trump, whose super PACs have yet to establish a meaningful footprint.
