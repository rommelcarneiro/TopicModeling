For more than a decade, John Giuca has been fighting a verdict that declared him guilty of murdering a college student in 2003 at a party at his family’s house in Brooklyn. But after several court hearings and the filing of numerous legal briefs, a judge on Thursday turned down his request for a new trial.

Mr. Giuca, 32, was convicted in 2005 of killing Mark S. Fisher, a Fairfield University student whose body was found a few blocks from Mr. Giuca’s house in the Prospect Park South neighborhood. At a closely watched trial, prosecutors argued that Mr. Giuca was a member of a fledgling gang who had gone after Mr. Fisher to gain street credibility. They also said he had been jealous over a woman with whom Mr. Fisher was flirting and had been angry at him for drunkenly sitting on his parents’ table.

From the moment of his conviction, Mr. Giuca and his family have tried to overturn it, occasionally through unconventional measures. After the trial, his mother, Doreen Giuliano, assumed a false identity and struck up friendships with the jurors, hoping to discover evidence of misconduct. More recently, his lawyer, Mark A. Bederow, filed papers claiming that a jailhouse informer who implicated Mr. Giuca had since recanted and that prosecutors had withheld exculpatory evidence.

In his ruling, Justice Danny K. Chun said that while the informer, John Avito, had indeed changed his statement, the recantation should not be trusted because Mr. Avito had lied so often. Justice Chun also ruled that the prosecution had no obligation to obtain and disclose Mr. Avito’s psychiatric records, which Mr. Bederow discovered only after the trial.

Mr. Giuca showed no reaction as Justice Chun ordered him back to prison. But Ms. Giuliano refused to leave the courtroom, crouching on the floor and calling out, “No! They took my son!”

Mr. Bederow told reporters he was disappointed but not discouraged by the ruling and promised to appeal.
