Matt Szczur hit his first career grand slam during a five-run eighth inning, and the Cubs broke away from the Atlanta Braves, 6-1, on Friday in Chicago.

Jon Lester struck out 10 over seven innings as the Cubs improved to 17-5, their top 22-game start since the 1907 team went 18-4.

It was 1-1 in the eighth when the Cubs loaded the bases on two hits and a walk against Jim Johnson (0-3). Eric O’Flaherty relieved and gave up Anthony Rizzo’s go-ahead single with one out.

Szczur followed by launching a pitch from Chris Withrow over the left-field wall.

Freddie Freeman’s solo shot in the fourth was only the Braves’ fifth home run of the season.

PIRATES 4, REDS 1 Juan Nicasio struck out eight in seven scoreless innings, Josh Harrison hit his first home run in nearly a year, and Matt Joyce connected as a pinch-hitter to lead the Pittsburgh to a victory over visiting Cincinnati, extending a winning streak to five games.

Nicasio (3-2) allowed three hits and one walk in sending the Reds to their fifth straight loss.

ORIOLES 6, WHITE SOX 3 Nolan Reimold hit a tiebreaking three-run homer in the seventh inning, leading host Baltimore to a victory over Chicago.

The White Sox entered the series riding a six-game winning streak but have lost back-to-back games to the Orioles, whose 9-1 mark at Camden Yards is the best home record in the majors.

Brad Brach (3-0) earned the win in relief of Mike Wright.

PHILLIES 4, INDIANS 3 Ryan Howard led off the 11th inning with a home run, leading host Philadelphia to a victory over Cleveland.

Howard’s homer was his fifth of the season and his sixth career game-ending shot.

RANGERS 4, ANGELS 2 Ian Desmond continued his batting surge with two hits, including the go-ahead double in a three-run sixth inning, and Texas beat visiting Los Angeles.
