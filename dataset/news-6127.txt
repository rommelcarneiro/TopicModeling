Good evening. Here’s the latest.

1. President Obama will become the first sitting U.S. president to visit Hiroshima, one of the two Japanese cities the U.S. hit with atomic bombs to force Japan’s surrender in World War II. The highly symbolic trip, set for late May, is meant to further the quest to rid the world of nuclear weapons, according to a presidential aide, “not revisit the decision to use the atomic bomb.” Above, a memorial ceremony last year for the 70th anniversary of the bombing.

2. Here’s a gauge of how effective Bernie Sanders’s message has been in changing Hillary Clinton’s platform. After months of resisting his calls for a single-payer health care system, she has begun shifting left, suggesting she’d like to let people buy into Medicare.

_____

3. “The first E.T. candidate.” That’s what space enthusiasts have called Mrs. Clinton, who has proved surprisingly willing to discuss the possibility of extraterrestrial beings and pledges to open the files on Area 51. Asked recently if she believed in U.F.O.s, she said that she didn’t know, but that “There’s enough stories out there that I don’t think everybody is just sitting in their kitchen making them up.” Above, Mrs. Clinton campaigning in Kentucky.

4. Not even Michael Jordan managed it, though LeBron James and Shaquille O’Neal came close. Stephen Curry got every last N.B.A. vote for most valuable player. His record-shattering 402 3-pointers helped power the Golden State Warriors to the best regular season ever. And his return to the playoffs this week after a knee problem bolsters the team’s chances for a second consecutive title.

_____

5. Severe weather continued to threaten the Ohio Valley and parts of Texas a day after thunderstorms, giant hail and nearly two dozen tornadoes struck across five states. Above, one of the twisters that struck Oklahoma.

_____

6. Brazil’s struggle over President Dilma Rousseff grew yet more chaotic. A congressional official backtracked after a surprise move to block her impeachment. That raised the likelihood that the Senate will vote Wednesday to suspend her and put her on trial for manipulating the federal budget. Above, a protest against the impeachment.

_____

7. An annual ranking revealed that the 25 best-paid hedge fund managers took home a staggering $12.94 billion in income last year, despite disruptive volatility. Kenneth Griffin, above, is one of two who topped the list with $1.7 billion. A political donor, he helped Rahm Emanuel win reelection in Chicago and poured $3.1 million into the failed presidential campaigns of Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush and Scott Walker.

_____

8. Investigators unraveling what prosecutors call a huge fraud in Vermont say two businessmen “systematically looted” millions of dollars from foreign investors. The mechanism: a federal program that grants green cards in exchange for major investment in distressed areas. Above, an area where promised redevelopment never arrived.

_____

9. He’s 16, 6-foot-8 and a rising Olympic hopeful. One of our best-read stories today is about Reece Whitley, a Philadelphia swimmer our sportswriter says is “on the fast track in school and swimming.” He’s an ambitious student whose classes include Mandarin Chinese and advanced chemistry, an African-American in a sport beginning to lose its monochrome cast and the rare top male athlete coached by a woman.

_____

10. Finally, there’s more Central Park for New York City nature lovers. A four-acre section near the southeast corner will be open regularly for the first time since the 1930s. Robert Moses, the powerful urban planner who long served as parks commissioner, closed it off as a bird sanctuary. A couple whose Fifth Avenue apartment overlooks the spot donated benches.
