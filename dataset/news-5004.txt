Times Insider shares insights into how we work at The New York Times. Today, Andrew Rosenthal, editorial columnist, responds to recent news: the good, the bad and that which makes him mad.

What is Mr. Rosenthal mad about this week? News that Bernie Sanders supporters threw chairs and made death threats against the state’s party chairwoman after a divisive Nevada Democratic convention. “Completely out of control,” says Mr. Rosenthal, “This is not grass-roots populism. It’s just straightforward thuggish behavior.”

The worst news of the week, in Mr. Rosenthal’s view, comes from the Supreme Court, which this week returned a case on access to contraception to the lower courts for further consideration.

“That there is a vacancy on the Supreme Court, and the U.S. Senate will not even consider the president’s nominee is just an outrage,” says Mr. Rosenthal who sees the apparently deadlocked justices as evidence that the Republican party has effectively removed the court from any “meaningful existence in public life.”

Mr. Rosenthal, a “Game of Thrones” enthusiast, says the good news is that the show is back on TV again. And, in the “just hilarious” department, Mr. Rosenthal looks to the Republican Party establishment that, despite early expressions of outrage, is now stepping in line to support Donald J. Trump, he observes.
