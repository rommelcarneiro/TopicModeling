A 16-year-old Brooklyn boy was sentenced on Tuesday to 12 years to life in prison for accidentally shooting a man in the back of the head on a public bus two years ago.

The boy, Kahton Anderson, was convicted in February in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn of second-degree murder in the death of Angel Rojas, 39, who was shot on a crowded B15 bus during the evening rush on March 20, 2014. Mr. Anderson, whose first trial in April 2015 ended in a partial verdict, had pulled out a silver .357 revolver from his backpack and opened fire on three rival gang members he feared were threatening him, unintentionally striking Mr. Rojas, who was talking on his cellphone.

After the shooting, Mr. Anderson, who at the time was an eighth-grade student and a basketball player at Junior High School 57 in Bedford-Stuyvesant, ran off the bus to pursue his rivals, emptying his gun on the street.

Mr. Rojas, an immigrant fruit vendor and the father of two children, was taken to Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center, where he was pronounced dead.

A member of a gang called Stack Money Goons, Mr. Anderson had argued at his trials that he had acted in self-defense, claiming that members of a rival gang, the Twan Family, had shot at him earlier in the day. He said he had taken the bus to avoid stepping on the other gang’s turf — “treacherous territory,” as his lawyer, Frederic Pratt, called it. But once on board the bus, he encountered three Twan Family members and used the revolver, which, Mr. Pratt said, he and his friends had shared.
