Certain dances — especially those packed with details — warrant intimacy. The Mark Morris Dance Group grants that wish with a spring season at its Brooklyn quarters, with new and vintage works by the stellar Mr. Morris and, as always, live music. Along with the return of “Foursome” (2002), a suite of dances for four men featuring music by Erik Satie and Johann Nepomuk Hummel, and “Cargo” (2005), set to Darius Milhaud’s “La Création du Monde,” Op. 58, the company presents the premiere of “A Forest.” The new dance, for nine, is set to Haydn and includes costumes by the former company member Maile Okamura. Mr. Morris wraps things up with “The,” first shown last summer at Tanglewood Music Center. In that work, to Bach, same-sex couples run with clasped hands; there are raised fists. Does “The” have to do with marriage equality? One thing is sure: The close quarters will make Mr. Morris’s details shine.
