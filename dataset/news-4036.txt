Good evening. Here’s the latest.

1. “Seventy-one years ago, on a bright cloudless morning, death fell from the sky and the world was changed.” President Obama became the first sitting U.S. president to visit Hiroshima, acknowledging the more than 100,000 people killed in the U.S. atomic bombings at the end of World War II. He embraced survivors and called for “a moral revolution” to rein in nuclear weapons, a frustrated goal of his presidency.

2. In the presidential race, backers of Bernie Sanders are holding out hope that the F.B.I.’s investigation will result in the indictment of Hillary Clinton over her email troubles. This weekend, Donald Trump will be campaigning at the huge Rolling Thunder biker rally in Washington, and Mr. Sanders will be in California, which holds its primary on June 7. The Libertarians have their convention in Florida, amid speculation that they might put forward a third-party contender.

3. Top U.S. executives aren’t exactly hurting, but their average compensation last year — a tidy $19.3 million — was down 15 percent from 2014. Some analysts see the dawn of a corrective era of corporate modesty. If so, Expedia hasn’t heard. Its C.E.O., Dara Khosrowshahi, above left, made $94.6 million. And Yahoo’s leader, Marissa Mayer, made $36 million. Here are the highest paid 200.

4. The Transportation Security Administration sent a “surge” of additional officers to the nation’s 20 busiest airports, hoping to reduce long security lines as the Memorial Day Weekend begins the summer travel season. Even so, be sure to give yourself a time buffer.

_____

5. For summer reading, our critics recommend “The Girls,” by Emma Cline, in which a teenage girl drifts into a ’60s-era Manson-like cult. Or “Being a Beast,” in which the author, a British veterinarian, burrows, swims and skulks alongside nonhuman animals. For binge-watching, you could try Laura Dern in “Enlightened,” a poetic character study in half-hour increments.

_____

6. Talk about cross-disciplinary breakthroughs. Geneticists analyzed the DNA of more than 3,700 African Americans and found a trail of history running from pre-slavery to the Great Migration, above. Genes from white males, for instance, signal the coerced sex enslaved women faced. Experts said the DNA map would help show how genes influence African-Americans’ risk for disease.

_____

7. The Islamic State is under sharp attack in both Syria and Iraq. U.S. Special Operations forces helped Kurdish and Arab fighters push closer to Raqqa, the Islamic State’s Syrian stronghold. And the militants are under siege in their Iraqi haven of Falluja, where reports of starvation are building. Above, Iraqi fighters celebrated gains.

_____

8. Egyptian officials added to the confusion surrounding the crash of of EgyptAir Flight 804, responding with silence to reports that the plane may have sent an emergency signal in its final moments. A French naval vessel fitted with high-tech sensors is speeding toward Egyptian waters to join the search for the plane’s black boxes before their batteries fail in a couple of weeks. Above, a memorial in Cairo for the 66 people lost.

9. The U.S. reached a troubling milestone. The first infection involving a bacteria resistant even to a last-resort antibiotic was identified. That could lead to the rise of so-called superbugs. An expert compared it to a puzzle: “You need lots of different pieces to get a result that is resistant to everything. This is the last piece of that puzzle, unfortunately.”

_____

10. A federal study urged new caution over the intensely debated issue of cellphone radiation. Researchers found that male rats exposed to RFR, or radio-frequency radiation, had a somewhat higher risk for brain and heart tumors. Critics disputed the findings, but the researchers urged more study, noting that even a small increase in risk “would have broad implications for public health.”

_____

11. Finally, Manhattanhenge is upon us. That’s the brief period when the setting sun aligns perfectly with Manhattan’s east-west street grid. It’s best seen at 8:12 p.m. Eastern on Sunday and Monday, and again on July 11 and 12. Other gridded cities with roughly east-west orientations experience something similar, just at different times. A Chicago astronomer suggests calling the nearest planetarium to see if your city has its own “-henge.”

Have a great weekend.
