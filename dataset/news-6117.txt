A growing number of restaurants cultivate their own herbs, greens and so forth on terraces and, increasingly, outside the city. Blue Hill is the prime example; others include Narcissa, Blenheim and even P.J. Clarke’s, too. Now, in addition to its rooftop garden, Rosemary’s, along with its sister restaurants Claudette and Bobo, is tilling 40 acres near Fishkill, N.Y., in Dutchess County. What sets it apart is that it will sell its organic bounty, including eggs, flowers and optional fresh pasta, to the public in community supported agriculture shares: $400 for 20 weekly baskets from mid-June to mid-October, $240 for 10 biweekly baskets, to be picked up at Rosemary’s, 18 Greenwich Avenue (10th Street), rosemarysnyc.com/farm. Shares available until June 1.
