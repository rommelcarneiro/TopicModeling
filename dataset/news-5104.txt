Lincoln Center Theater has named the director Evan Cabnet to run LCT3, its program for producing work by new artists.

Mr. Cabnet, 38, will succeed Paige Evans as artistic director of the program on July 1; Ms. Evans is leaving Lincoln Center to become the artistic director of Signature Theater Company.

“New play development has always been my passion — even more than directing, what I like to do is find new writers and find new plays and be their champion,” Mr. Cabnet said. “There are a lot of things I want to do: I want to do plays by writers that New York audiences are not yet familiar with, I’d like to do more musicals up there, and I’d like to find theater companies that might be a good fit and invite them in.”

LCT3 was established in 2008, with Ms. Evans as its first director; among its most notable productions was Ayad Akhtar’s “Disgraced,” in 2012, which went on to win a Pulitzer Prize the following year.

Mr. Cabnet directed the Roundabout Theater Company production of “Thérèse Raquin,” starring Keira Knightley, on Broadway this season, and in 2012 directed an ill-fated production of “The Performers” on Broadway. He has also been a prolific director beyond Broadway; his projects have included last week’s semi-staged revival of “Do I Hear a Waltz?” at Encores!; “Off the Main Road,” starring Kyra Sedgwick, last summer at Williamstown Theater Festival; and “Gloria,” by Branden Jacobs-Jenkins, last season at the Vineyard Theater.

He has two more directing projects scheduled: this summer, a revival of “An American Daughter,” by Wendy Wasserstein, at Williamstown, and this winter, a remounting of “Gloria” at the Goodman Theater in Chicago.

After, that, he said, he would stop directing to focus fully on work directed and designed by others: “I want to be only the artistic director, so I can just be a champion of this next wave of artists.”
