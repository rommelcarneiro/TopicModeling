The World Trade Center transportation hub’s recently opened Oculus will host performances for the first time as part of this year’s River to River festival, which runs June 16 through 26 at various locations around Lower Manhattan and Governors Island.

According to the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, which puts on the festival, the performances at the Oculus will be pop-ups, with details released shortly before they take place via social media, like the organization’s Twitter, Facebook or Instagram accounts.

Other highlights from River to River include dance, music and theater, as well as art exhibitions and open studios. The interdisciplinary artist Saya Woolfalk’s “ChimaTEK: ChimaCloud Control Center” (June 16, 21 and 23) opens the festival with an array of live performances at Fulton Center. Other performances include dances by Dance Heginbotham (June 17-19), Eiko (June 19, 21-22) and Will Rawls (June 20-22).

On June 22 Olga Bell, who sang and played keyboards with the band Dirty Projectors, brings her song cycle “Krai” to 28 Liberty Plaza. The performance will be a revival of a 12-person arrangement Ms. Bell wrote for a sold-out premiere at Walker Art Center in Minneapolis in 2014.
