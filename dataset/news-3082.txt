As part of the NY Phil Biennial, the hard-working members of the impressive Brooklyn Youth Chorus and the San Francisco Girls Chorus will unite on Thursday, June 9, for an adventurous collaboration with the Knights, the dynamic chamber orchestra.

The young performers must have been excited to be included on the roster, because they prepared quite a few new and recent pieces. So many that the event is structured as an evening double bill, with a break in between for a Play Date, a chance for composers and performers to mingle with audience members.

The program includes works by Philip Glass, Theo Bleckmann, Caroline Shaw and Gabriel Kahane. (7 and 8:30 p.m., Rose Theater, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 212-875-5656; nyphil.org.)
