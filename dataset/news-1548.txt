NEW DELHI — Eleven men were sentenced on Friday to life in prison for participating in a mob that set fire to a housing complex in western India where scores of Muslims were taking refuge, killing 69 people inside.

Thirteen other men convicted in connection with the crime received sentences of seven or 10 years.

The killings occurred during riots in 2002 in the state of Gujarat, then under the leadership of an ambitious politician, Narendra Modi, who is now India’s prime minister.

Mr. Modi was blamed by many at the time for failing to take swift action to stop the riots, but a court ruled that there was no evidence to prosecute him.

The site of the massacre was the Gulbarg Housing Society, a residential complex in the city of Ahmedabad that was home to Ehsan Jafri, a Muslim politician. Witnesses said that Mr. Jafri made repeated telephone calls to officials for help but that the police did not arrive in time to prevent the killings.

The special court set up to try the case acquitted 36 people for lack of evidence.

Jakia Jafri, Mr. Jafri’s widow, told reporters that the sentences were too lenient and that she would appeal them and continue to fight to hold state officials accountable for the crime.

The riots in Gujarat followed the burning of 59 Hindu pilgrims in a moving train near a station in Godhra, a locality largely inhabited by Muslims.
