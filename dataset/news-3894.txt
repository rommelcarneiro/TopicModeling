I really should just write “NO!” 150 times. But having investigated, I can confirm that Pumpkin is really cute. Cuter even than the garbage-eating monster that opened my door with its demon hands and walked into my living room in Brooklyn just to show me he could kill me at any time. And he could: raccoon feces frequently carry an infectious parasite that can blind you, put you in a coma and kill your kids. Even Pumpkin’s owner warns that raccoons shouldn’t be kept as pets. Is she trying to suppress competing pet-raccoon-stagrams? Probably. But regardless, it’s almost certainly illegal for you to have one in your state, unless you register it as a phony companion animal, which would make you as monstrous as the raccoon. So: NO!
