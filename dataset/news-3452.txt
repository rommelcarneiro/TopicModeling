The last time Barbra Streisand appeared on the Tony Awards, Richard M. Nixon was president and the Beatles had just broken up.

Now, 46 years later, she’s coming back. Ms. Streisand has agreed to appear as a presenter at this year’s Tonys.

Details were scant on Wednesday: Organizers of the awards would not say what exactly Ms. Streisand would be presenting on the June 12 broadcast.

But the announcement was still sure to thrill Broadway, and, the Tony Awards organizers hope, television audiences who might have yet another reason to tune in. This year’s Tony Awards ceremony promises to be more viewer friendly than most — the popularity of “Hamilton” has producers hoping audiences will flock to watch that show’s cast perform, and the broadcast’s host, James Corden, has an established fan base thanks to his late-night television show.

But Ms. Streisand is in a league of her own. She has won two Oscars, five Emmys, and eight Grammys (plus two special Grammys). She has twice been nominated for Tony Awards — for “I Can Get It for You Wholesale,” in 1962, and “Funny Girl,” in 1964, and won a special Tony for “star of the decade” in 1970.

Ms. Streisand is preparing to tour in August, and is promoting a new theater-focused duets album, “Encore: Movie Partners Sing Broadway.”

Among the other presenters at this year’s Tony Awards, which will air at 8 p.m. Eastern time on CBS: Oprah Winfrey, Cate Blanchett, Steve Martin, Edie Brickell, Carole King, Audra McDonald, Saoirse Ronan, Patina Miller and Nathan Lane.
