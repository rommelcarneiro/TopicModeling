LONDON — The European Commission said on Tuesday that it had signed off on Anheuser-Busch InBev’s more than $100 billion merger with SABMiller after the companies agreed to sell SABMiller’s premium brands in Europe and some other European operations.

The combination of SABMiller and Anheuser-Busch would create a beer industry giant that would account for about 30 percent of global beer sales. In hopes of winning regulatory approval, Anheuser-Busch has entered into a number of agreements to sell a variety of assets from the combined company.

In April, it accepted an offer by Asahi Group Holdings of Japan to buy the beer brands Grolsch, Meantime and Peroni, as well as associated SABMiller operations in Britain, Italy and the Netherlands, for 2.55 billion euros, or about $2.9 billion.

Anheuser-Busch also said in April that it would be willing to sell SABMiller’s assets in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia as part of a package of divestments to win approval from European regulators.

“Today’s decision will ensure that competition is not weakened in these markets and that E.U. consumers are not worse off,” Margrethe Vestager, the commissioner in charge of European competition policy, said in a news release.

“Europeans buy around 125 billion euros of beer every year, so even a relatively small price increase could cause considerable harm to consumers. It was therefore very important to ensure that AB InBev’s takeover of SABMiller did not reduce competition on European beer markets,” she added.

In its review, the commission found that the transaction, without concessions, would have most likely led to higher prices for beer in Europe, particularly in countries where SABMiller had been an active competitor.

The merger of two of the four largest brewers in the European Economic Area “would have significantly increased the number of national markets where the merged entity and the two remaining major supranational brewers would encounter each other as competitors,” the commission found. “Fewer players, encountering each other in a higher number of markets, would have found it easier to tacitly coordinate on prices at national level.”

The commission said the divestitures had eased its concerns about competition after the transaction.

“These commitments taken together address all the commission’s competition concerns, including those based on an increased number of multimarket contacts, as AB InBev has committed to divest essentially all the European businesses that it initially planned to acquire from SABMiller,” the commission said.

Anheuser-Busch agreed in November to acquire SABMiller after months of negotiations in a deal that it said would create the first “truly global brewer.”

The combination would give Anheuser-Busch, already the world’s largest brewer, a substantial operation in Africa, where it has little presence, and greater dominance in Latin America.

As part of its efforts to win regulatory approval, Anheuser-Busch has entered into agreements around the world to shed brands and assets.

In November, Anheuser-Busch agreed to sell SABMiller’s 59 percent stake in MillerCoors in the United States to SABMiller’s partner in a joint venture, Molson Coors Brewing, for about $12 billion. That deal includes the global rights to the Miller brand and would make Molson Coors the second-largest brewer in the United States, behind Anheuser-Busch.

In March, China Resources Beer, a state-owned brewer, agreed to buy SABMiller’s 49 percent stake in the maker of Snow, the world’s best-selling beer. The deal would value SABMiller’s stake in CR Snow around $1.6 billion.

The divestments are all contingent on the Anheuser-Busch-SABMiller merger closing. Anheuser-Busch hopes to close the deal for SABMiller in the second half of this year.

SABMiller said the transaction has now been cleared in 14 jurisdictions, including the European Union.

“In the remaining jurisdictions where regulatory clearance is still pending, AB InBev will continue to engage proactively with the relevant authorities to obtain the necessary clearances as quickly as possible,” SABMiller said in a news release on Tuesday.
