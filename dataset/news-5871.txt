In pop music it was the week of gray English miasma: sudden releases of new records by James Blake on Thursday, May 5, and Radiohead on Sunday, May 8. Mr. Blake’s minimal “The Colour In Anything” makes the strongest case yet for him as a defenseless, lost-love songwriter, though at extravagant length: an hour and a quarter. And Radiohead’s maximal “A Moon Shaped Pool,” its first album in five years, reconciles the aloneness of Thom Yorke’s sound and persona with the collaborative-minded and sometimes orchestral visions of the group’s guitarist Jonny Greenwood.

Sudden-drop records are becoming more common, but they still punch through the news cycle. Here were two examples of records whose punches were weary, patient, dystopian, abstracted, complicated, with much stillness and falsetto singing. I reviewed Mr. Blake’s record and Jon Pareles reviewed Radiohead’s; on this popcast we compare notes.
