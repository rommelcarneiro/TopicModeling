Northern Ireland secured its first victory in a major competition in 34 years on Thursday, beating Ukraine, 2-0, in Lyon, France.

Building on a strong finish to the first half, Gareth McAuley headed in a free kick from Oliver Norwood in the 49th minute. Niall McGinn, a substitute, added a second deep in stoppage time as Ukraine was trying to tie.

The victory, Northern Ireland’s first since beating host Spain in the 1982 World Cup, means the team has a good chance of qualifying for the knockout stages of the European Championships.

Following its opening 1-0 loss to Poland, Northern Ireland now has 3 points.

Northern Ireland’s next Group C game is against world champion Germany on Tuesday at the Parc des Princes in Paris.

“We put it right, and we’ve got a big game to look forward to in Paris,” McAuley said.

Northern Ireland grew more confident through the first half and, when McAuley scored, recorded its first goal in an international competition since the 1986 World Cup.

For Ukraine, it was a second straight 2-0 loss, and it left the team languishing in last place in Group C with zero points. Ukraine plays Poland in its next match on Tuesday in Marseille.
