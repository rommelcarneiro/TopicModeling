An article on April 10 about the political ambitions of Boris Johnson, the departing mayor of London, referred incorrectly to a program offering free subway service for Londoners 60 and over. It was instituted in 1973 by the Greater London Council, not by Mr. Johnson.

An article on April 27 about the confirmation by Colombia of two more cases of babies born with brain damage to mothers who had Zika during pregnancy misstated the year when researchers found Zika gene sequences in the blood of three children in Haiti. It was in December 2014, not 2015.

NEW YORK

An article on Friday about a public hearing on options for shutting down the L Train tunnel during repairs misstated the name of a food market in Brooklyn. It is Smorgasburg, not Smorgasbord.

SPORTS

An article last Monday about the former Islanders goaltender Rick DiPietro’s new career as a television analyst misstated, in some copies, the status of the contract he signed with the team in 2006. It would have had several years remaining; this season would not have been its next-to-last season.
