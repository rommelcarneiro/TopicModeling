LONDON — Barclays said on Wednesday that it planned to sell a 12.2 percent stake in the Barclays Africa Group as it moves to reduce its holdings in the business in an accelerated strategy shift led by its new chief executive.

The British bank announced plans in March to sell down its 62.3 percent stake in the African business over the next two to three years, and James E. Staley, its chief executive, said the action announced Wednesday was “an important first step.”

Barclays, which has operated in the region for more than a century, wants to reduce its holdings in the African business to below a controlling level or sell the stake entirely. The goal is to free Barclays from regulatory and capital requirements that have dragged on its balance sheet.

“We continue to explore opportunities to reduce our shareholding, including capital market and strategic options,” said Mr. Staley, who is known as Jes, in a news release.

The Barclays African business is listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and holds majority stakes in banks in 10 countries, with offices in two others. The business’s biggest profit driver is South Africa.

The African business was considered one of four pillars of Barclays’s strategy, alongside its credit card and its consumer and investment banking operations, under Antony Jenkins, who was ousted as chief executive in July.

Under Mr. Staley, the bank is accelerating the sale of businesses it does not consider core operations and focusing its strategy around two divisions: the British consumer bank, and the corporate and investment bank.

Barclays said it would sell 103.6 million shares, or 12.2 percent of the business, in a private offering to institutional investors.

The Public Investment Corporation, an investment manager owned by the South African government, has agreed to serve as an anchor investor in the sale, buying up to 10.3 million shares, or about 1.2 percent of Barclays Africa.

The announcement of the planned sale came just over a week after Atlas Mara Limited, an investment company backed by the former Barclays chief executive Robert E. Diamond Jr., said it was in discussions with a group of investors about exploring a bid for Barclays’s African business.

Atlas Mara was formed in 2013 to invest in financial services companies in Africa.

Barclays’s investment bank will serve as the sole global coordinator on the offering.
