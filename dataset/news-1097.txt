The New York Times’s Modern Love column has long been a favorite among readers — and it recently made a splash in the podcast world, as well.

At this month’s Times Insider event, Daniel Jones, the column’s editor since its inception in 2004, spoke with Dan Barry, a columnist and reporter at The Times, and Jessica Alpert, who manages the team at WBUR that produces “Modern Love: The Podcast.”

The conversation centered on a Modern Love column written by Mr. Barry in 2009, one that explored the death of his daughter’s fish — outwardly an odd choice for a column about love. (Mr. Barry’s column was one of the first to be recorded as a podcast when The New York Times partnered with WBUR in early 2016.)

Listen to the podcast in full to find out how Mr. Jones selects and edits his columns, how Mr. Barry’s fish story came to life and how Ms. Alpert transformed Mr. Barry’s 1,500-word essay — and the many others — into a moving audio experience.
