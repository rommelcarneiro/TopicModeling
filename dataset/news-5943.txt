City Center, the longtime host of beloved series like Fall for Dance and Encores!, will add a new festival to the mix next season: a New York edition of the annual Vail International Dance Festival.

In announcing its upcoming season, City Center said Vail Dance Festival: ReMix NYC would run from Nov. 3 through Nov. 6 and include fixtures of the festival’s summer season in Colorado, like Isabella Boylston and Herman Cornejo of American Ballet Theater and Robert Fairchild, Tiler Peck and Sara Mearns of New York City Ballet. Other performers include the MacArthur recipient and tap dancer Michelle Dorrance and the tango star Gabriel Missé.

City Center’s dance season begins in September, as usual, with its annual Fall for Dance festival, known for making every seat in the theater available for $15. Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, Ballet Theater and other companies will perform from Sept. 26 through Oct. 8.

Also returning to City Center is the ballerina Natalia Osipova, who performed her “Solo for Two” program there last year. In November, she will present a mixed bill of New York premieres that she commissioned from three choreographers — Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui, Russell Maliphant and Arthur Pita — after a world-premiere run at Sadler’s Wells in London this summer. Other dance highlights include seasons by Nederlands Dans Theater (Nov. 16-19), Ailey (Nov. 30-Dec. 31) and Dance Theater of Harlem (April 19-22).

Encores!, City Center’s concert staging of largely forgotten cult favorites of Broadway, will include Roger Miller’s “Big River: The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,” from 1985; Cole Porter’s “The New Yorkers,” from 1930; and John La Touche and Jerome Moross’s “The Golden Apple,” from 1954. The lineup for Encores! Off-Center, a similar series that showcases Off Broadway musicals, will be announced at a later date.
