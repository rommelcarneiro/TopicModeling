PITTSBURGH — Sidney Crosby beat Andrei Vasilevskiy from the circle 40 seconds into overtime, and the Penguins beat the Tampa Bay Lightning, 3-2, in Pittsburgh on Monday night to leave the N.H.L. Eastern Conference finals tied at a game apiece.

Crosby, who had not scored in the postseason since the opening round against the Rangers, took a feed from Bryan Rust and buried it for his fourth goal of the Stanley Cup playoffs. Matt Cullen and Phil Kessel also scored for the Penguins.

Matt Murray overcame a shaky start to finish with 19 saves as Pittsburgh improved to 3-1 in overtime in the postseason.

“They generated a lot, and he still made some great saves, kept us in it,” Crosby said.

Anton Stralman scored in his return to the lineup from a fractured left leg, and Jonathan Drouin picked up his second goal in two games, but the Lightning lost for just the third time in 12 postseason games when Vasilevskiy could not handle Crosby’s wrist shot.

Vasilevskiy played brilliantly at times while filling in for injured starter Ben Bishop, making 38 stops.

Game 3 is Wednesday night in Tampa.

The Penguins pointed to an inability to generate quality chances from in close as a major problem in Game 1. In danger of falling behind by two games for the first time in the postseason, Pittsburgh wasted little time trying to make Vasilevskiy uncomfortable, scoring two early goals on scrambles from in front.

Cullen, 39, pounded home a rebound 4 minutes 32 seconds in for his fourth goal of the playoffs. Just over five minutes later Kessel darted in from the point and zipped one by Vasilevskiy to give the Penguins control before the first period was halfway complete.

In the span of three minutes, Pittsburgh’s momentum vanished. Stralman collected a pretty cross-ice feed from Jonathan Marchessault and lifted the puck over Murray’s outstretched glove to cut the lead in half with 3:23 to go in the first, and Drouin’s knuckler from the right circle tied it with 70 seconds remaining.

Lightning Coach Jon Cooper predicted that the opener, which included two illegal hits that ended with Penguins defensemen Kris Letang and Brian Dumoulin woozily making their way off the ice, may end up being the “tamest” of the series. Yet the fireworks never really developed, although Ryan Callahan’s absence might have had something to do with that.

Callahan’s elbow to the back of Letang’s neck that sent Letang headfirst into boards set a surprisingly chippy tone for two teams that have little playoff history. Callahan’s chop drew a five-minute major but no further discipline from the league, though Callahan found himself out of the lineup anyway after falling ill before the game.

Save for the usual heightened postseason pushing and shoving, both teams kept to themselves.

Still, the return of the smooth skating Stralman gave the Lightning a boost at the blue line. Making his first appearance since March 25, he was on the ice during Cullen’s score but picked up his fifth career playoff goal when he roofed it by Murray, the Penguins rookie who has been steady since taking over in Game 3 in the opening round.
