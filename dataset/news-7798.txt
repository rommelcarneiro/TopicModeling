Oliver Sacks, the neuroscientist and author who died of cancer last year, will be honored in a tribute to open this year’s World Science Festival in New York.

The festival, which runs from June 1 to June 5, will feature various talks and other events in Manhattan and Brooklyn, including a revival of “Light Falls: Space, Time and an Obsession of Einstein,” a popular theatrical production from last year.

The tribute, “Awakening the Mind: A Celebration of the Life and Work of Oliver Sacks,” June 1 at 8 p.m., will bring together Dr. Sacks’s famously bizarre stories, as well as those of his friends, co-workers and patients, for a multimedia presentation to remember the doctor who used “his patients’ disorders as starting points for eloquent meditations on consciousness and the human condition,” as Gregory Cowles wrote in The New York Times.

“Light Falls” — a collaboration among the festival’s co-founder, the scientist Brian Greene; the “House of Cards” composer Jeff Beal; and others — will be featured on June 3.

On June 4, “Gravitational Waves: A New Era of Astronomy Begins” will build on recent news of scientists’ discovering and recording the sound of two black holes colliding — confirming a prediction of Einstein about the existence of gravitational waves. Scientists from the project will speak in a panel discussion about what the discovery means for studying the universe.

Other programs include stargazing in Brooklyn Bridge Park and a talk hosted by the actor and science literacy advocate Alan Alda.

The full lineup will be available at worldsciencefestival.com.
