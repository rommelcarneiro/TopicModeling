Is “The Taming of the Shrew,” Shakespeare’s battle-of-the-sexes comedy, too 16th-century retro for audiences in 2016? It is notable that over the last decade, of the few high-profile revivals in New York, the casts of two have been entirely single-sex. Perhaps producers think the play’s dated gender politics require a conceptual idea that allows audiences to see the play with new eyes.

Edward Hall staged an all-male version at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 2007, and this summer one of the two offerings at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park will be an all-female production, staged by Phyllida Lloyd (who has also staged productions of “Julius Caesar” and “Henry IV” with all women). This new outdoor production benefits from some superb actors in the lead roles as warring romantic partners: Cush Jumbo (“The River,” “Josephine and I”) and Janet McTeer (who won a Tony for “A Doll’s House”). (From Tuesday, May 24, to June 26, Delacorte Theater, publictheater.org.)
