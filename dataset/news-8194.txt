So many great, poetic plays take place in bars that you could program an entire season of them and save money on the set. A natural start would be “The Iceman Cometh,” but my dream lineup would then include Stephen Adly Guirgis’s portrait of Manhattan in transition, “In Arabia We’d All be Kings,” which would provide a nice contrast with the rural Irish pub in Conor McPherson’s “The Weir.” Joining this genre, packed with monologues of uncommon beauty and gradually escalating inebriation and conflict, is “Daphne’s Dive,” a new work by Quiara Alegría Hudes that takes place in a cheap corner bar in North Philadelphia. It centers on a relationship between the title character, who tends bar, and her adopted daughter. Ms. Hudes won a Pulitzer Prize for the drama “Water by the Spoonful” (part of an acclaimed trilogy) and wrote the book for Lin-Manuel Miranda’s musical “In the Heights,” which was directed by Thomas Kail, who also stages this new work. Vanessa Aspillaga (“Domesticated”) and Daphne Rubin-Vega (“Rent”) fill out this ensemble. Begins Tuesday, April 26, at Signature Theater; 212-244-7529, signaturetheatre.org.
