It’s not easy covering Donald J. Trump. A celebrity millionaire candidate, he jeers his opponents on the stump and on Twitter — and he doesn’t pull punches with reporters, either.

Michael Barbaro and Megan Twohey, two members of The Times’s politics team, know that as well as anyone.

Both have been writing about Mr. Trump’s campaign. Mr. Barbaro has also covered Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush, as well as Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential run. Ms. Twohey, an investigative reporter who recently joined The Times, also wrote about Ted Cruz’s troubled half sister.

Their recent article on Mr. Trump and his relationships with women got an enormous reaction from Mr. Trump and his supporters. For that piece, Mr. Barbaro and Ms. Twohey spoke with dozens of women both on and off the record and combed through hundreds of pages of published interviews, depositions, court transcripts and books.

This article also brought them unprecedented personal attention, both positive and negative — and it’s still coming their way.

In this Inside The Times podcast, Mr. Barbaro and Ms. Twohey explain what it’s like to cover Donald Trump, and share some of the feedback The Times is still getting from readers.

Carolyn Ryan, The Times’s politics editor, is the guest host.
