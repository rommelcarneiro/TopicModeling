Valanciunas had 11 points and 7 rebounds in the fourth quarter and overtime as the Raptors avoided losing consecutive games for the first time this postseason.

Game 3 is Saturday afternoon in Miami.

The Heat led by 77-70 midway through the fourth, but back-to-back baskets by Valanciunas shaved the gap to 80-78 with 3 minutes 18 seconds remaining. Ross tied it with a jumper at 2:01.

DeRozan missed a pair of free throws with 1:22 remaining, but Valanciunas grabbed the rebound on the second and tipped it home to give Toronto an 82-80 lead. After a missed shot by Wade, Lowry hit a pull-up jumper with 45 seconds left, giving the Raptors a 4-point cushion.

Wade cut it to 1 with a 3-pointer, but Lowry replied with another jumper with 14.9 seconds to go, putting Toronto up by 86-83. After a Miami timeout, Dragic tied with a 3-pointer with 10.5 seconds left.

Lowry, whose halfcourt shot sent Game 1 to overtime, got the last shot off for the Raptors but could not hit the rim with a long 3-point attempt.

The Heat went cold in overtime, missing their first five field-goal attempts, including three misses by Johnson. DeRozan and Valanciunas connected and Carroll made two free throws before Miami’s first basket of overtime, a driving dunk by Deng with 23 seconds left.
