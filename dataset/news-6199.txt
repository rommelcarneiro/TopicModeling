Andy Murray split with his coach, Amélie Mauresmo, on Monday, ending a groundbreaking two-year relationship during which Murray improved as a clay-court player but failed to add to his collection of Grand Slam titles.

A statement released by Murray’s management company did not disclose the reason behind the decision, although Mauresmo said, “dedicating enough time along with the travel has been a challenge for me.”

She gave birth to her first child in August and took six months off.

“Working with Andy over the last two years has been a fantastic experience for me,” said Mauresmo, a former top-ranked player who won the Australian Open and Wimbledon in 2006. “I’ve thoroughly enjoyed being part of the great team of people he has around him.”

Murray was the highest-profile men’s tennis player to have a woman as a coach, bringing Mauresmo on board in June 2014.

By that time, he was a two-time Grand Slam champion — at the United States Open in 2012 and Wimbledon in 2013 — and had also won a gold medal at the London Olympics in 2012.

Under Mauresmo, Murray reached the final at the Australian Open in 2015 and 2016, losing both times to Novak Djokovic. He won his first clay-court titles last year in Munich and Madrid.

“I’ve learned a lot from Amélie over the last two years, both on and off the court,” Murray said in the statement. “She’s been a calming influence in the team and we will all miss having her around.”

Murray, ranked third, is heading into a busy period, with the French Open, Wimbledon, the Olympics and the United States Open in the next four months.

“I’ll take some time to consider the next steps and how we progress from here,” Murray said, “but I’d like to thank her for everything she has done. She’s been an invaluable member of the team.”
