Gabrielle David Schonder and Vijay Shivram Iyer were married May 7. Rabbi Rami Shapiro officiated at Southall Meadows, an event space in Franklin, Tenn.

The bride, 30, works from New Canaan, Conn., as a producer and reporter for “Frontline” on PBS. She graduated from Hendrix College in Conway, Ark.

She is a daughter of Deana E. Goldstein and James C. Schonder of Nashville.

The groom, 34, is the senior corporate counsel at the Priceline Group, the online travel company, in Norwalk, Conn. He graduated from Columbia and received a law degree from the University of Texas.

He is the son of Shanthi S. Iyer and Shivram K. Iyer of Plano, Tex.

The couple met in November 2012 at an election night party and discovered a mutual love of books, so they started a book club. After several months as friends, Mr. Iyer asked her out.
