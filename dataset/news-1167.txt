United States stocks rose sharply on Monday as investors grew hopeful that Britain would remain in the European Union.

Asian stocks traded higher and indexes in Europe soared as the latest opinion polls and betting markets suggested it was more likely that Britain would stay in the E.U. Britons vote in a referendum on the matter on Thursday.

The British pound rose sharply, and investors dumped ultrasafe assets like American government bonds, gold and utility stocks, sending those prices lower. Machinery and consumer companies jumped, and energy companies rose with the price of oil.

Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist at Northern Trust, said Britain’s status in the E.U. would not affect American businesses much, though it could hurt European banks. Investors, he said, were worried about what would happen to the union if Britain did leave. “It’s not the direct effects that people are worried about, it’s the indirect ones,” he said.

The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 12.03 points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,083.25. The Nasdaq composite gained 36.88 points, or 0.8 percent, to 4,837.21. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 129.71 points, or 0.7 percent, to 17,804.87.

Stocks had been on pace for much larger gains earlier. At one point, the Dow was up 271 points.

Machinery companies climbed. The aerospace company Boeing added $2.93, or 2.3 percent, to $132.75 and Honeywell advanced $1.14, or 1 percent, to $117.06. General Electric rose 23 cents to $30.83.

Consumer stocks rose as investors bet people would spend more on shopping and travel. Amazon gained $7.62, or 1.1 percent, to $714.01, while the travel booking site Priceline added $32.72, or 2.5 percent, to $1,341.96, and Nike rose 65 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $54.36.

Benchmark United States crude oil rose $1.39, or 2.9 percent, to $49.37 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained $1.48, or 3 percent, to $50.65 a barrel in London. After a six-day losing streak, oil prices were up about 7 percent over the last two days.

Among energy stocks, Chevron rose $1.04, or 1 percent, to $102.61. Marathon Oil jumped $1.32, or 10 percent, to $14.48, after it agreed to pay $888 million for PayRock Energy.

Bond prices dropped as investors moved money out of ultrasafe assets. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.68 percent from 1.61 percent late Friday. That’s an encouraging sign for banks since bond yields are used to set interest rates on many kinds of loans — including mortgages — and banks will be able to make more money from lending as rates increase.

Bank of America rose 14 cents, or 1 percent, to $13.54 and Wells Fargo, the nation’s biggest mortgage lender, rose 33 cents to $46.93.

JD.com, the second-largest e-commerce site in China, jumped after it said it was buying Walmart’s Yihaodian marketplace as part of a broad partnership with the company. JD.com rose 93 cents, or 4.6 percent, to $21.06.

FedEx rose after the federal government moved to dismiss charges against it. Prosecutors had planned to charge FedEx with knowingly delivering illegal prescription drugs to dealers and addicts, but the government dropped the case late Friday. FedEx picked up $2.22, or 1.4 percent, to $164.47.

The FTSE 100 in Britain leapt 3 percent and the CAC 40 in France rose 3.5 percent. The German DAX was up 3.4 percent. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index surged 2.3 percent. The South Korean Kospi climbed 1.4 percent and in Hong Kong the Hang Seng added 1.7 percent.

In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline added 8 cents, to $1.58 a gallon. Heating oil edged up 5 cents, to $1.53 a gallon. Natural gas rose 12 cents, to $2.75 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Gold slipped $2.50, to $1,290 an ounce. Silver rose 10 cents, to $17.51 an ounce. Copper added 4 cents, to $2.09 a pound.
