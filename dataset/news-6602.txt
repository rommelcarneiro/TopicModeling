ST. LOUIS — Cody Eakin scored 2 minutes 58 seconds into overtime and the Dallas Stars beat the host St. Louis Blues, 3-2, on Thursday night, bouncing back from a blowout loss two days earlier to tie their second-round Stanley Cup playoff series at two games apiece.

Patrick Sharp set up the winner and also scored for the Stars, who were coming off a 6-1 loss in Game 3. The rookie Radek Faksa had the other goal for Dallas.

Vladimir Tarasenko scored his sixth goal of the playoffs on a first-period breakaway and added an assist for St. Louis, giving him five points in the last two games. Paul Stastny also scored off a deflection from Tarasenko.

Game 5 is set for Saturday in Dallas.

Eakin has a goal and seven assists in the postseason. He beat Brian Elliott on a three-on-two break after the Blues pressured goalie Kari Lehtonen on the opposite end.

The Stars are 1-2 in overtime in the playoffs, and the Blues are 2-2.

Tarasenko’s goal was an exception to the rule in a tight-checking first period. Somehow he found the defense napping and scored his 16th career goal in 24 playoff games, beating Lehtonen between the pads.

The Stars looked worse on the play given that they had six men on the ice, an infraction that went undetected.

Faksa, who had the deciding goal in the Stars’ Game 1 victory, tied it on an unassisted goal off a giveaway by another rookie, Joel Edmundson. Sharp had a tap-in for his first point of the series on a power play off an assist by Jamie Benn, giving the Stars two goals in 1:09 and the lead.

Dallas had been 0 for 12 with the man advantage before Sharp’s fourth goal of the playoffs over all.

Edmundson played sparingly the rest of the period, totaling 2:38 in four shifts.

Stastny’s first goal of the playoffs on a deflection from Tarasenko tied it on a four-on-three power play at 13:06 of the second.

Tarasenko leads the Blues with 11 points in the postseason.
