Alden Ehrenreich has officially been cast as the young Han Solo in a coming stand-alone “Star Wars” film from Disney. The movie, as yet untitled, will follow Solo’s life before 1977’s “Star Wars: Episode IV — A New Hope.” Mr. Ehrenreich will follow in the footsteps of Harrison Ford, who, of course, originated the role.

Mr. Ehrenreich, 26, starred in “Beautiful Creatures” (2013) and had a supporting role in Woody Allen’s “Blue Jasmine” (2013). He also appeared earlier this year in the Coen brothers’ film “Hail, Caesar!” alongside George Clooney, Channing Tatum and Scarlett Johansson.

Set to be released in May 2018, the “Star Wars” movie will be directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller, the filmmakers behind “The Lego Movie” and “21 Jump Street.”
