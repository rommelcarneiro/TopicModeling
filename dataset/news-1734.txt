Domhnall Gleeson, recently seen in “The Revenant,” will play A. A. Milne, the author of the “Winnie-the-Pooh” books, in a new film, “Goodbye Christopher Robin.” The movie will also star Margot Robbie (soon to be seen in “The Legend of Tarzan”) as Milne’s wife, Daphne.

The film, written by Frank Cottrell Boyce and Simon Vaughan, and directed by Simon Curtis, will tell the story of Milne and his son, Christopher Robin, whose stuffed toys and own doings were the inspiration for the Pooh tales. It is set soon after Milne won fame in the late 1920s for his books about the small teddy bear and his friends, and will focus on how the family handled their newfound fame.

In a BBC report Mr. Curtis said that he was delighted to tell “a remarkable and poignant story.” Winnie-the-Pooh was first featured on film by Disney in “Winnie-the-Pooh and the Honey Tree” (1966). A release date for “Goodbye Christopher Robin” was not announced.
