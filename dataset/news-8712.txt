Two people were killed in fires in Brooklyn and Queens on Monday, the authorities said.

A 52-year-old man died when a fire burned through a home at 205-16 113th Road in the St. Albans neighborhood of Queens around 9 a.m., the Police Department said in a statement.

Firefighters found the man unconscious and unresponsive inside the building, and paramedics transported him to a Queens hospital, where he was pronounced dead, the police said.

The second fire began around 6 p.m. and burned through the second and third floors of a 20-foot-by-50-foot building at 203 Fenimore Street in the Prospect-Lefferts Gardens neighborhood of Brooklyn, Francis X. Gribbon, a Fire Department spokesman, said.

The person killed in the second fire was an occupant of the building whose body was found inside more than two hours after firefighters arrived on the scene, officials said. One of the injured was a neighbor who had minor smoke inhalation, the department said. The other eight were firefighters who sustained minor “bumps, burns and bruises.”

The authorities declined to release the names of either victim on Monday pending the notification of their families. The cause of both fires was under investigation, they said.
