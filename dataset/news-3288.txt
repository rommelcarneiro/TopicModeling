“Hamilton” is going to run for a long time. But Lin-Manuel Miranda’s time in the title role is about to end.

For months, it has been widely understood, and discussed in theater publications, that Mr. Miranda, who also wrote the musical, would leave the show this summer, after the Tony Awards are handed out and the cast’s one-year contracts expire.

But on Thursday, discussion about his impending departure intensified when The Hollywood Reporter said that confidants of Mr. Miranda, whom it did not name, had been told his final date in the show would be July 9.

Spokesmen for the production and for Mr. Miranda would neither confirm nor deny the report. But July 9 is when contracts for the principal actors expire — the show began previews on Broadway last July 13 — and a person with direct knowledge of Mr. Miranda’s plans said he had made it clear that he would depart around that time.

The show’s producers have been negotiating with other actors over contract renewals — presumably at higher salaries, particularly for anyone who wins a Tony at the ceremony on June 12 — but those negotiations are not likely to be resolved for a few weeks.

One prominent member of the show’s opening-night cast, Jonathan Groff, who played King George III, has already moved to Pittsburgh for a role in a television show, “Mindhunter.” Several other cast members, for a variety of reasons, have indicated that they expect to depart this summer rather than negotiate contract renewals.

Mr. Miranda will remain actively involved in “Hamilton” as the show’s creator. And he has multiple other projects lined up: He is writing the music for “Moana,” a Disney animated film; he is starring opposite Emily Blunt in “Mary Poppins Returns,” a Disney live-action film; and he is working on the film adaptation of his previous musical, “In the Heights.”
