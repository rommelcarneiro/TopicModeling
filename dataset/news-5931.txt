The country superstar Garth Brooks will play his first New York City concert in nearly two decades when he brings his world tour to Yankee Stadium on July 9.

The singer has not performed here since a free Central Park concert in the summer of 1997, when The New York Times noted that his “style is about as foreign to New York City as Lou Reed’s is to Oklahoma, Mr. Brooks’s home state.” That show featured a 360-foot-long stage and boasted a reported attendance of 750,000.

Tickets for the Yankee Stadium event, which also features Mr. Brooks’s wife, Trisha Yearwood, go on sale on May 20 at 10 a.m. Eastern time via Ticketmaster.

“The last time he was in New York, hundreds of thousands of people came from all over the world to see him,” says a dramatic teaser trailer posted to Mr. Brooks’s social media accounts. “Now, 19 years later, he returns.”

In 2014, Mr. Brooks re-entered the spotlight with the album “Man Against Machine,” his first collection of original music since 2001. Jon Caramanica, writing in The Times, called the album “grand scale and hammy, in places eye-rollingly schlocky and in others outrageously moving.”

Mr. Brooks, one of the best-selling acts in music, has since teased new material, telling Billboard last year: “I’m gonna stay an album guy. In fact, concept albums are really blowing my mind right now, because if you want to promote an album, think about it — a concept album might be the way to go.”
