So she designed a playful and therapeutic riff on sunbathing: At night, under the full moon, guests receive foot and shoulder massages while lounging on beach chairs, to the soothing sounds of the nearby ocean.

“No one flies to Jackson Hole, Wyoming, to sit in a yoga studio,” says Courtney Riley, who created a lunar yoga hiking retreat for the Four Seasons there. Unlike typical hatha and vinyasa practices, which are devised around sun salutations that energize, detoxify and stimulate the body, the nighttime-inspired practice is “about cooling, calming and centering.” A stargazing event rounds out the experience.

Sedona’s Boynton Canyon has a rich Native American cultural history — and, according to Mii Amo’s spa director, Doreen Young, “an energy that is very powerful.” Two new massages are offered during the full moon and the new moon, which Young says play an important role in manifesting and releasing thoughts, emotions and energies. Before the treatments, guests write what they want to release on pieces of paper — and then crumple it up and light it on fire. There is also a centering scalp massage, and foot baths with essential oils like juniper for grounding, and sage and frankincense to help foster good intentions.
