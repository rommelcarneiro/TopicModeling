The streaming service Tidal added more than 15 Prince albums to its catalog early Tuesday, on what would have been his 58th birthday.

The collection includes “The Black Album,” which Prince canceled just before its planned release in 1987. (The album was a heavily trafficked bootleg before coming out officially seven years later.) Also included are live releases and albums from the 1990s and early 2000s, after he left the Warner Bros. label, like “Crystal Ball” and “The Rainbow Children,” many of which got negative reviews from critics at the time.

Prince, who maintained tight control of his catalog, withdrew almost all of his music from streaming services last year, but kept his catalog on Tidal, the service bought by Jay Z early in 2015 and presented as an artist-friendly platform.

“After one meeting, it was obvious that Jay Z and the team he has assembled at Tidal recognize and applaud the effort that real musicians put in2 their craft 2 achieve the very best they can at this pivotal time in the music industry,” Prince said in a statement last August, announcing a new album, “HitNRun Phase One,” as a Tidal exclusive.

Last week, the Midwest Medical Examiner’s Office reported that Prince died from an accidental overdose of self-administered fentanyl, a type of synthetic opiate. He left no will, and a court in Minnesota has yet to rule on how his estate will be divided.
