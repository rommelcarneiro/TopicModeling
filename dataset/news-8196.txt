John Eleuthère du Pont was supposed to be the future of USA Wrestling when he built, in the 1980s, a magnificent training center on his Foxcatcher Farm in Newtown Square, Pa., and invited some of the country’s best wrestlers to live there. But, on Jan. 26, 1996, he shot and killed Dave Schultz, the seven-time World and Olympic medalist who coached the Foxcatcher team. It’s a story familiar to anyone who saw “Foxcatcher,” Bennett Miller’s 2014 fictionalized account (Mark Ruffalo played Schultz).

Mark Schultz, Dave’s brother and training partner, is nowhere to be found in “Team Foxcatcher,” a new Netflix documentary debuting Friday, April 29. Instead, the director Jon Greenhalgh combines home movies of Dave with interviews of those he trained — and who witnessed du Pont’s menacing entitlement. Dave’s widow, Nancy, acts as a guide. “This main drive is just so pretty,” she says as she enters the estate at the film’s beginning. By its end, she is walking through the house she shared with her husband and their children, now in ruins.
