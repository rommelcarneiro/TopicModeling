Late last year, the former Vena Cava designer Sophie Buhai launched an eponymous jewelry and home line filled with sculptural, silver pieces and ceramic vases. Since then, the brand has built up a steady following — and is now carried by the likes of Net-a-Porter and Bergdorf Goodman.

Now, the Los Angeles-based designer makes her first foray into fine jewelry, unveiling a delicate new collection of precious and semi-precious stones. Her trademark egg-shaped pendant and earrings have been updated with a diamond speck, and a shapely piece of agate hangs from silver studs.

Buhai says the idea behind the collection, which will go on sale this fall, was to make something just a little bit fancier than everyday jewelry. “I was thinking of my mother in the ’90s, who always wore great costume jewelry with a black cocktail dress,” she says. “She’s a psychologist, a strong intellectual working woman with elegance.” She adds: “Very Catherine Deneuve in Chanel.”

The designer plans to further explore the world of semi-precious stones in future collections — in her signature minimal way. “I’m not into girly princess jewelry,” she says. “How can you makes a diamond look Bauhaus — is more my vibe.” Buhai gives T the exclusive first look at the collection, along with a film shot by the filmmaker and photographer Gillian Garcia.
