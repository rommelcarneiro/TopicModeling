Last week brought multiple disappointments from tech companies in their earnings reports. The question is whether it will get any better this week.

Some of tech’s largest companies will post financial results over the next few days, including Apple, Facebook and Amazon. Some of their smaller brethren are also on deck, including Twitter, eBay and LinkedIn.

The good news is that many of the factors that hurt the results of tech companies that reported last week are not as strong in the earnings that will coming out this week. Of the companies that stumbled last week, several — like IBM and Intel — were navigating the tricky transition from selling hardware and software primarily around personal computers to a mobile computing and cloud era. That’s less an issue for companies like Apple and Amazon, as they have led the way in mobile devices and cloud computing.

That doesn’t mean it will be all roses this week. Apple is grappling with a slowdown in the sales of its iPhones and the aftermath of a bruising battle with the F.B.I. over the privacy and security of its devices. Amazon’s cloud business has been thriving, but the company faces scrutiny for its prolific spending and thin profits.

And Facebook remains a disrupter. As Quentin Hardy and Mike Isaac explain in their most recent story, the vision of Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, of connecting the world will have plenty of ripple effects on other tech companies.

That’s because Mr. Zuckerberg’s vision will require a lot of equipment — and Facebook will want that gear at a cheaper price. So he has embraced open-source concepts to drive down the costs of tech equipment, which will inevitably ripple out to big hardware makers like Cisco Systems and Nokia.
