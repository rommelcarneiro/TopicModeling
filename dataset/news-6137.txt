An article on April 10 about a ship engineer’s account of a territorial dispute in the South China Sea in which a Chinese fishing trawler was seized by Indonesia and then taken back by the Chinese Coast Guard referred incorrectly in some editions to the Natuna Islands of Indonesia, where members of the Chinese fishing crew were detained. While they are the northernmost point of Indonesia in the South China Sea, they are not the northernmost point in the country.

Because of an editing error, an article on Monday about a theological battle being fought by Muslim imams and scholars in the West against the Islamic State misstated the Snapchat handle used by Suhaib Webb, one of the Muslim leaders speaking out. It is imamsuhaibwebb, not Pimpin4Paradise786.

An article on April 10 about Maj. Gen. M. Moein Faqir, the top military man in Helmand Province in Afghanistan, who has lost ground to the Taliban since he arrived five months ago but claims success in cleaning up corruption, misidentified the United States Army unit that reinforced the province in March. It is the 87th Infantry Regiment, which is part of the 10th Mountain Division, not the 87th Infantry Division.

BUSINESS DAY

An article on Monday about the hiring of James H. Shelton III, a former federal Department of Education official, to oversee the philanthropic efforts in education of the Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan, rendered incorrectly part of the name of a unit of the Department of Education. It is the Office of Educational Technology (not Education).

SPORTS

An article on Thursday about the Mets’ 8-0 victory over the Atlanta Braves referred incorrectly to an earlier start by Steven Matz in which he gave up seven runs in one and two-thirds innings. It was his first start of the season, not on opening day. The article also misstated, in some editions, the inning in which Matz surrendered a single to Braves pitcher Jhoulys Chacin. It was the third inning, not the fourth.

An article on Saturday about the Portland Trail Blazers’ attempt to rebound from a 2-0 deficit in their N.B.A. playoff series against the Golden State Warriors misstated, in some copies, the game of the series that contained a disastrous fourth quarter for the Blazers. It was Game 2, not Game 4. (Game 4 had not yet been played; it was Monday night.) The article also misstated, in some copies, the Warriors’ deficit entering the fourth quarter of Game 2. It was 11 points, not 9.

Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about the chaotic final seconds of the Oklahoma City Thunder’s 98-97 victory over the San Antonio Spurs in Game 3 of their N.B.A. playoff series misspelled the given name of one of the Spurs players who the N.B.A. said should have been called for a foul. He is Kawhi Leonard, not Kahwi.
