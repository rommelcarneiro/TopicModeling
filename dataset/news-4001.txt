Stocks rose on Friday to wrap up their strongest week in almost three months.

Banks gained ground after the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, Janet L. Yellen, said the central bank intended to keep raising interest rates if the economy continued to improve.

Stocks turned higher over the last few hours of trading to finish at their highest levels of the day. Banks made the largest gains, as they stand to make bigger profits on lending if interest rates rise further. Phone companies traded higher after Verizon reportedly agreed in principle to a new contract with its striking employees. Alphabet led technology stocks higher.

Ms. Yellen emphasized that the Fed would move slowly and carefully on interest rates. But there were signs that the economy was improving throughout the week, including increased home sales, leading to big gains for stocks. On Friday, the Commerce Department said the economy grew a bit more in the first quarter than it previously estimated.

“Both inflation and growth are on an upward trend,” said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist for BMO Global Asset Management. He said investors might be worrying a bit less about the Fed’s plans because the economy was showing signs of improving.

The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index added 8.96 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,099.06. The Nasdaq composite index picked up 31.74 points, or 0.6 percent, to 4,933.50.

The Dow Jones industrial average rose 44.93 points, or 0.3 percent, to 17,783.22.

Bank stocks were led higher by Bank of America, which rose 18 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $14.88, and Citigroup, which picked up 47 cents, or 1 percent, to $46.58.

Bank stocks have struggled this year because the Fed has pushed back plans to raise rates. Bond prices dipped and yields rose, another sign investors expect interest rates to increase. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.85 percent, from 1.83 percent on Thursday. The yield on the Treasury note is closely tied to interest rates.

Thomas Perez, the labor secretary, said Verizon and its unions had agreed in principle to a new four-year contract. About 39,000 landline and cable employees in the Eastern United States went on strike in April. They had been working without a contract since August. Verizon gained 46 cents, to $50.62.

Google’s parent company, Alphabet, rose after a federal jury said the company did not need permission to use tools made by Oracle when it built its Android software. Oracle had sought $9 billion in damages, and said it planned to appeal the ruling. Shares of Alphabet added $10.67, or 1.4 percent, to $747.60.

Benchmark American crude oil lost 15 cents, to $49.33 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, gave up 27 cents, to $49.32 a barrel in London.

The machinery maker Terex dropped after the Chinese heavy equipment maker Zoomlion abandoned its effort to buy the company. Zoomlion offered to buy Terex at the start of the year, after Terex accepted an offer from Finland’s Konecranes. Terex backed out of that deal and will instead sell its crane business to Konecranes. Terex stock sank $3.44, or 14.1 percent, to $20.89.

The scientific equipment maker Thermo Fisher said it would buy the electron microscope maker FEI for $107.50 a share in cash, or about $4.2 billion. Two months earlier, Thermo Fisher paid $1.3 billion to buy Affymetrix, a company that makes equipment to analyze genetic codes. FEI stock climbed $13.55, or 14.3 percent, to $108.13, and Thermo Fisher added 93 cents, to $152.13.

The price of gold fell $6.60, to $1,213.80. Gold has slipped about 5 percent over the last two weeks.
