Stocks perked up after a downbeat start to eke out a small gain Wednesday.

Consumer companies were among the big gainers as investors assessed a mixed bag of new data on the manufacturing, housing and automobile industries. Telecommunications stocks lagged the rest of the market.

The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index added 2.37 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,099.33. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 2.47 points, or 0.01 percent, to 17,789.67. The Nasdaq composite index gained 4.20 points, or 0.1 percent, to 4,952.25.

The major indexes opened lower on Wednesday, echoing a slide in markets in Europe and Asia as traders considered new reports on China’s manufacturing sector, including one suggesting a weaker outlook for the nation’s factories.

Investors also got an early look a mix of new domestic data. The Commerce Department said construction spending fell in April by the biggest amount in five years, dragged down by declines in housing, commercial construction and spending on government projects.

Separately, car shopping site Kelley Blue Book projected that domestic auto sales slumped 7 percent in May, usually one of the strongest months for the industry. The drop is the biggest monthly decline since August 2010.

Most major automakers reported lower sales in May compared with May 2015. Shares of General Motors lost $1.06, or 3.4 percent, to $30.22, while Ford Motor shares slid 38 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $13.11.

Shares of CarMax, the auto dealership chain, fell $1.57, or 2.9 percent, to $52.09.

The Institute of Supply Management said that domestic factories expanded for the third straight month in May, helped by a weaker dollar. “It’s another data point in the direction of things being O.K.,” said Jason Pride, director of investment strategy at Glenmede.

Investors’ outlook improved by late afternoon, when the Federal Reserve released its latest snapshot of the economy, the so-called beige book.

The Fed’s latest survey of business conditions found that half of its 12 regions described growth as modest, while Dallas said economic activity had increased “marginally.” Two districts — Chicago and Kansas City — said growth had slowed from the last report. New York described activity as “generally flat.”

The government’s next monthly update on nonfarm hiring is due Friday.

“It’s been a mixed picture, but with enough elements in the picture to keep the Fed in play to raise rates,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial.

Beyond economic data, investors kept an eye on companies reporting quarterly results or outlooks.

Bank earnings dipped 2 percent in the first three months of the year to $39.1 billion from $39.8 billion a year earlier, data issued Wednesday by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation showed.

Michael Kors led all companies in the S.&P. 500 index, climbing 6.6 percent after reporting that strong online sales and new store locations helped raise revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter. Its results exceeded Wall Street’s expectations. The stock gained $2.80 to close at $45.54.

Cracker Barrel, the restaurant change, vaulted 8.4 percent after reporting strong earnings growth for its fiscal third quarter. The stock added $12.74 to $164.22.

Other companies did not fare as well. Under Armour slumped 3.9 percent to $36.25 after slashing its full-year revenue guidance and saying that the closure of Sports Authority stores will hurt its sales. A bankruptcy court recently decided to approve the liquidation of privately held Sports Authority, which sold Under Armour goods, rather than a restructuring or sale.

Markets in Europe closed lower. Germany’s DAX fell 0.6 percent, while France’s CAC 40 slid 0.7 percent. Britain’s FTSE 100 lost 0.6 percent. The downbeat data on China’s factories weighed on markets there and elsewhere in Asia.

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.3 percent. Japan’s Nikkei 225 finished 1.6 percent lower, while South Korea’s Kospi slipped less than 0.1 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 slumped 1 percent.

United States crude oil slipped 9 cents to close at $49.01 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, slid 17 cents to close at $49.72 a barrel in London.

In other energy futures trading, natural gas rose 9 cents, or 4.1 percent, to close at $2.38 per 1,000 cubic feet. Wholesale gasoline was little changed at $1.62 a gallon and heating oil was also flat at $1.50 a gallon.

Among metals, gold fell $2.80 to $1,214.70 an ounce, while silver slid 7 cents to $15.93 an ounce. Copper fell 2 cents to $2.07 a pound.

Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.84 percent from 1.85 late Tuesday.

In currency markets, the dollar weakened to 109.48 yen from 110.72 yen in Tuesday’s trading. The euro rose to $1.1191 from $1.1124.
