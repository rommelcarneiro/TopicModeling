Paul Millsap had 17 points and 8 rebounds, and the Atlanta Hawks beat the Boston Celtics, 104-92, on Thursday night to advance to the second round of the N.B.A. playoffs.

The Hawks open the second round on Monday at Cleveland.

Al Horford and Kent Bazemore each added 15 points for the Hawks, who earned their first playoff series win over Boston since the St. Louis Hawks beat the Celtics in the 1958 N.B.A. finals.

Coming off a 27-point win in Game 5, the Hawks took advantage of poor shooting by Boston to build a lead that reached as many as 28 points. Atlanta shot 74 percent from the field during a 39-point third quarter.

The Celtics made a final charge to cut Atlanta’s lead to 10 points, but the Hawks were able to hold them off.

Isaiah Thomas had 25 points and 10 assists for the Celtics, whose last three playoff appearances have ended in first-round exits.

NO-CALL UPHELD Dwyane Wade was not fouled on Miami’s final offensive play of a loss to Charlotte in Game 5 of their Eastern Conference first-round series, the N.B.A. determined.

Wade thought he had been fouled with 2.6 seconds left as he tried to tie Wednesday’s game. No call came, and the Heat lost, 90-88.

The Hornets lead the series, three games to two. Game 6 will be at Charlotte on Friday.

CAVS’ LUE BACKS EX-COACH Cavaliers Coach Tyronn Lue would like to see the man he replaced, David Blatt, find another N.B.A. job.

“He definitely deserves another chance,” Lue said. “I thought Coach Blatt did a great and phenomenal job here.”

Blatt was fired in January despite a 30-11 record. Lue then guided Cleveland to the top seed in the Eastern Conference.
