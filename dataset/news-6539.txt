The Yankees have put the left-hander C. C. Sabathia on the 15-day disabled list because of a strained groin.

The team brought up the left-hander Phil Coke from the minor leagues on Friday to replace him on the roster.

Sabathia, 35, was coming off his best start of the season Wednesday; he pitched seven shutout innings and struck out six at Baltimore. He is 2-2 with a 3.81 E.R.A.

This is another blow to the last-place Yankees. Before Wednesday’s game, designated hitter Alex Rodriguez went on the 15-day disabled list with a strained right hamstring.

Sabathia’s move to the disabled list was retroactive to Thursday.
