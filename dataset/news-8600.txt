SummerStage announced its full 2016 lineup, including performances by Trevor Noah, the Indigo Girls and Public Enemy. The lineup, organized by the City Parks Foundation, includes more than 100 free shows of music, comedy, dance and theater in parks across New York City’s five boroughs.

As previously announced, the season will place an emphasis on jazz, and kick off with a tribute to McCoy Tyner with sets by Mr. Tyner, Ron Carter and Roy Haynes in Central Park on June 4. The saxophonist Kamasi Washington will perform June 18, and the Charlie Parker Jazz Festival will take place in various locations Aug. 26-28.

A large chunk of the season will happen in Central Park. Trevor Noah will perform standup there, along with others from “The Daily Show,” on June 26. “A Ballerina’s Tale,” a documentary about Misty Copeland of American Ballet Theater, will be screened in tandem with a ballet premiere from Jeremy McQueen on June 29. The Indigo Girls will perform on June 27, and Brasil Summerfest will bring Monobloco, Boogarins and more on Aug. 6. The musical “Chicago” will celebrate its 20th year on Aug. 31, with appearances from the current Broadway cast.

Performances elsewhere around the city include Public Enemy at Betsy Head Park in Brooklyn on June 21, Chairlift in Red Hook Park, also in Brooklyn, on June 14 and the Metropolitan Opera Summer Recital Series, with concerts in all five boroughs. More information is at summerstage.org.
