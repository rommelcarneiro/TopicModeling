Her pining for classic Americana runs through Industry Standard, her jeans label inspired by unfussy, mid-20th-century silhouettes — and was stoked during a recent, spur-of-the-moment trip to Cuba with her best friend, the artist Mary Corman. “She’s also very nostalgic, perhaps even more than I am. She called me on a Friday and said, ‘It’s about to be summer, and it’s too hot to go then, and who knows how different it’ll be by the fall,’ so we booked it.” And they were en route to Havana two weeks later.

The duo roamed the Old City, admiring both the historic architecture and automobiles, stopped by the studio belonging to the Cuban contemporary artist Glenda León, shadowed local fan-painters and printmakers and browsed the bookstores. They also caught the ferry to Regla, a residential neighborhood left untouched by tourism, and toured Finca Vigía, Ernest Hemingway’s former home, just east of Havana — with Najafi documenting it all. “Looking at my photographs, the bright color combinations were so stunning; normally, for me, gray is a color and medium gray is wild,” says Najafi, who wore a pair of white jeans, of her own design, every day of her trip. “The pink and red ... the pistachio green,” she lists, thinking aloud: “Am I getting into color now?”

Here, Najafi gives T an exclusive look at her seven-day stay in Cuba.
