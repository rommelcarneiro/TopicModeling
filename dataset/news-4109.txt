WASHINGTON — Business spending intentions in the United States weakened in April for a third straight month, and contracts to buy previously owned homes surged to a 10-year high, data released on Thursday showed.

Another report showed that the number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits fell last week, supporting views that economic growth is gaining speed.

“The weak performance in business capital investment activity suggests that this segment remains a source of drag for the U.S. economic recovery,” said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York. “Over all, domestic growth momentum appears to be on the mend.”

The Commerce Department said orders for nonmilitary capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, fell 0.8 percent after slipping 0.1 percent the previous month. These so-called core capital goods orders have now declined for three consecutive months.

The manufacturing sector remains pressured by lower energy prices, which have eroded profits of energy companies and forced oil field services firms like Schlumberger and Halliburton to slash capital spending budgets.

Manufacturing, which accounts for 12 percent of the economy, has also taken a knock from efforts by businesses to slim down an inventory bloat, which has undercut growth in new orders. A strong dollar has been a drag on exports.

Shipments of core capital goods, used to calculate equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, rose 0.3 percent last month, reversing March’s 0.3 percent drop.

Much of the factory sector weakness has been concentrated in the heavy machinery segment, where manufacturers have also been hurt by reduced demand for agricultural equipment. In April, orders for machinery tumbled 1.9 percent after dropping 0.8 percent in March.

In a separate report, the National Association of Realtors said its pending home sales index jumped 5.1 percent last month to its highest level since February 2006. Pending home contracts become sales after a month or two, and April’s surge pointed to further gains in home resales.

The housing market is being underpinned by a tightening labor market, which is starting to lift wages, as well as still very low mortgage rates. But a shortage of properties available for sale remains a hurdle and house prices have risen faster than wages, sidelining some first-time buyers.

A third report, from the Labor Department, showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 268,000 for the week ended May 21.

Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a strong job market, for 64 straight weeks, the longest stretch since 1973.

The pending homes sales and jobless claims data joined reports on retail sales, housing and industrial production in suggesting the economy was gaining steam after growth slowed to a 0.5 percent annual pace in the first quarter. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta is currently estimating second-quarter G.D.P. growth at a 2.9 percent rate.

The Commerce Department report also showed orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft meant to last three years or more, jumped 3.4 percent last month after increasing 1.9 percent in March.

The rise in durable goods orders last month was led by an 8.9 percent jump in bookings for transportation equipment. Orders for civilian aircraft soared 64.9 percent. There were increases in orders for motor vehicles, fabricated metal products, computers and electronic goods, and electrical equipment, appliances and components.

Durable goods inventories declined further in April, a good sign for the manufacturing’s future prospects, while unfilled orders increased 0.6 percent. Durable goods shipments rose 0.6 percent after two consecutive months of declines.
