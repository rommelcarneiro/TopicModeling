HARRISON, N.J. — Lloyd Sam scored on a set play in the 37th minute Friday night and the Red Bulls added three goals in the second half to beat M.L.S.-leading F.C. Dallas, 4-0.

The Red Bulls (3-6-0) scored on a coordinated play off Sacha Kljestan’s free kick. Kljestan floated it over the defense, where Sal Zizzo was wide open to head it back across the 6-yard box and Sam finished from close range.

Sam’s long-distance chip shot in the 52nd minute crashed high off the crossbar and caught goalkeeper Jesse Gonzalez out of position and Kljestan raced in to head home the rebound.

Mike Grella made the score 3-0 with a header in the 71st minute, and Felipe’s strike from the top of the penalty arc capped the scoring in the 83rd minute.

The Red Bulls won their second straight after losing four in a row.

F.C. Dallas fell to 5-3-2.
