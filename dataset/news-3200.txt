“Titicut Follies,” a ballet based on Frederick Wiseman’s 1967 documentary about the Bridgewater State Hospital for the Criminally Insane in Massachusetts, and the New York premiere of Missy Mazzoli and Royce Vavrek’s opera, “Breaking the Waves” are among the offerings of the 2016-17 season at the N.Y.U. Skirball Center for the Performing Arts.

The season is strong on dance, opening with the Suzanne Farrell Ballet on Sept. 11 in a one-off staging-in-progress by Ms. Farrell of the second movement of George Balanchine’s little-seen “Gounod Symphony.” Other dance companies include Troy Schumacher’s BalletCollective (Oct 27-28), which will present two new works by Mr. Schumacher featuring his fellow New York City Ballet dancers, and Pilobolus Dance Theater (Nov. 16–Dec. 4).

On April 27-28, the James Sewell Ballet, in collaboration with Mr. Wiseman and the composer Lenny Picket, presents “Titicut Follies,” a project in conjunction with the Center for Ballet and the Arts at New York University.

The season also focuses on circus arts, presenting the Circus Now Festival (March 3-5) and the Montreal-based company Les 7 Doigts de la Main (April 11-16). Ms. Mazzoli and Mr. Vavrek’s “Breaking the Waves” (Jan 6 – 9), part of the 2017 Prototype Festival, is based on Lars von Trier’s 1996 Oscar-nominated film.

There will also be musicals from China, South Africa and South Korea.
