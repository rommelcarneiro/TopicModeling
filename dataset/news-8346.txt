The German automaker Daimler AG said late Thursday that it was conducting an internal investigation of its certification process for diesel exhaust emissions in the United States at the request of the Justice Department.

Last year, Volkswagen admitted to installing software in diesel vehicles sold since 2009 that let them emit up to 40 times the allowed amount of nitrous oxide, a pollutant. The Environmental Protection Agency said it would review all light-duty diesel vehicles in the United States.

“Daimler is cooperating fully with the authorities. Daimler will consequently investigate possible indications of irregularities and of course take all necessary actions,” Daimler said in a statement. “The company’s experience with the U.S. authorities has clearly shown that a conservative communication supports the constructive dialogue with the authorities.”

The Environmental Protection Agency said in February that it had requested information from Daimler in light of a lawsuit filed by Mercedes-Benz owners in the United States, but that it had not opened an official investigation.

Earlier this month, owners of Mercedes diesel cars in the United States filed a new class action saying the vehicles most likely contained a “defeat device” used to cheat emissions testing, an accusation that Daimler, which owns the carmaker, denied.

Daimler said Thursday that the lawsuits “are considered to be without merit and Daimler will defend itself against them with all available legal means.”
