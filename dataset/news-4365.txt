Dizengoff A shiny scarlet counter anchors this much-anticipated and long-delayed stand from the hummus master Michael Solomonov, who made his name in Philadelphia and has expanded to New York. It’s a larger space than the original. With his partners, Steven Cook and the chef Emily Seaman (who has 40-pound batches of chickpeas cooking all day so the hummus is fresh), he is offering some new items: small Israeli vegetable salads, shakshuka in the morning and, in a while, “a little supper,” as Mr. Solomonov put it. “We’re looking to expand,” Mr. Cook said. “I don’t think we’re opening in New York for just one location.” Originally the partners hoped to open a branch of their Federal Donuts in New York, but hummus took precedence. The doughnuts may still be on the horizon: Chelsea Market, 75 Ninth Avenue (15th Street), 646-833-7097, dizengoffhummus.com.

Olmsted It’s only fitting that the chef Greg Baxtrom and his partner Ian Rothman have a wall of greenery and a spacious garden in a restaurant they’ve named for the landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted. Asparagus, peas, onions, radishes, fiddleheads, ginger, lemons, herbs and flowers are some of the crops that will go into a seasonal American menu that conveys a whiff of France. (Wednesday): 659 Vanderbilt Avenue (Park Place), Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, olmstednyc.com.

Schilling Eduard Frauneder has been busy this year, first opening his Greenwich Village brasserie, Freud, and now this downtown restaurant named for the pre-euro currency of his native Austria. More bistro than brasserie, Schilling, in a tenement building dating from 1871, uses reclaimed lumber and touches of white, gold and sage; it has a communal table and seating in a garden. Mr. Frauneder’s menu is mostly Mediterranean, with a few Austrian inevitables like Wiener schnitzel and strudel. (Wednesday): 109 Washington Street (Rector Street), 212-406-1200, schillingnyc.com.
