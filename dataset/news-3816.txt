Mark Salling, an actor best known for playing the bad boy love interest in the Fox TV series “Glee,” was charged in a two-count federal indictment on Friday with receiving and possessing child pornography, the Justice Department said in a statement.

Mr. Salling, 33, who played Noah “Puck” Puckerman on the musical dramedy for six seasons, from 2009 to 2015, was arrested last December by the Los Angeles Police Departmant and Homeland Security Investigations, a branch of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, on child pornography charges.

During his arrest, the authorities searched his home in Shadow Hills, Calif., and seized a laptop, a hard drive and a USB flash drive that contained thousands of pornographic images and videos depicting children, the department said on Friday. He was released on a $20,000 bond.

The case was referred to federal law enforcement officials after investigators discovered the extent of the child pornography collection, the authorities said. The indictment on Friday specifically charged Mr. Salling with using the Internet on two dates in 2015 — Dec. 26 and Dec. 29 — to receive a still image and multiple videos depicting young girls.

“It doesn’t matter who you are or what you do, if you hurt a child you will be held accountable,” Lt. Andrea Grossman, Commander of the L.A.P.D. Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force, said in a statement. “These images are more than photographs, they are child abuse.”

The Justice Department said that Mr. Salling had agreed to turn himself in on June 3 and would be arraigned on that date.
