Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights from New York Times staff. In this podcast, Laurie Goodstein, the national religion correspondent, discusses her work covering sex abouse in the Catholic Church.

Laurie Goodstein is the national religion correspondent for The New York Times. Since 1994, Ms. Goodstein has written stories about sex abuse in the Catholic Church. Long before “Spotlight.”

Earlier this month, Ms. Goodstein wrote about revelations of a scandal — involving an extensive cover-up and as many as 50 priests and church officials in a Diocese in Pennsylvania.

In this podcast, she talks about what’s new and how the stories about abuse in the church have — and haven’t — changed in the 22 years she’s been covering the scandal.

Susan Lehman is host.
