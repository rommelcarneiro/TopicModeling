A rebound in the price of oil and natural gas helped drive sharp gains for energy and financial companies, nudging stocks mostly higher Friday.

The increase offset a slide in the technology sector after disappointing earnings from Microsoft and Alphabet, the parent of Google.

The Dow Jones industrial average managed a tiny gain, and the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index closed essentially flat. Both ended the week higher, but the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite fell short on both counts.

“The Nasdaq took a hit today,” said Erik Davidson, chief investment officer at Wells Fargo Private Bank.

The Dow rose 21.23 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,003.75. The S.&P. 500 index added 0.10 points to 2,091. The Nasdaq composite index lost 39.66 points, or 0.8 percent, to 4,906.23.

Trading was listless for much of the day, with the Dow and S.&P. 500 wavering between small gains and losses as the Nasdaq stayed in the red.

As was the case much of the week, investors were mostly focused on company earnings and energy prices. The latter helped lift several oil and gas companies.

Southwestern Energy notched the biggest gain in the S.&P. 500. The stock surged $1.60, or 15 percent, to $12.27. Range Resources shares rose $2.58, or about 7 percent, to $39.75, while stock in Chesapeake Energy climbed 36 cents, or 5.8 percent, to $6.55.

Investors cheered earnings from Norfolk Southern, whose shares rose 10.5 percent after the railroad operator slashed costs during its latest quarter. The stock gained $8.70 on Friday, to $91.33.

Quarterly results from several big-name companies failed to impress traders, however. Stock in the American Airlines Group fell 4.5 percent after the company said labor costs and weaker fares cut into its revenue in the first quarter. Its shares shed $1.80 to $38.21.

Microsoft shares fell 7.2 percent, making it the biggest decliner in the S.&P. 500. The stock lost $4 to $51.78, while Alphabet shares slid $40.37, or 5.3 percent, to $718.77. Over all, the technology sector was off about 2 percent.

Investors sold shares in Starbucks after the coffee chain reported disappointing sales growth for the first three months of the year. The stock lost $2.96, or about 5 percent, to $57.68.

Despite the declines, investors seemed to conclude that the issues driving lackluster results at Alphabet and Microsoft were largely confined to those companies, Mr. Davidson said.

“The broader market doing better,” he said. “Energy has to be part of that.”

Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.89 percent from 1.87 on Thursday.

Major stock indexes in Europe ended lower. Germany’s DAX fell 0.6 percent, while France’s CAC 40 slipped 0.3 percent. Britain’s FTSE 100 declined 1.1 percent.

In Asia, the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong fell 0.7 percent. The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo rose 1.2 percent. The Kospi in Seoul slid 0.3 percent and the S&P ASX 200 in Sydney lost 0.7 percent.

Benchmark United States crude oil rose 55 cents, or 1.3 percent, to settle at $43.73 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained 58 cents, or 1.3 percent, to settle at $45.11 a barrel in London.

Natural gas gained 7 cents, or 3.5 percent, to close at $2.14 per 1,000 cubic feet.

In other energy futures trading, wholesale gasoline added about a penny to $1.53 a gallon. And heating oil also rose a penny to close at $1.31 a gallon.

Precious and industrial metals futures were mixed. Gold fell $20.30, or 1.6 percent, to $1,230 an ounce, silver slid 19 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $16.90 an ounce and copper rose about a penny to $2.26 a pound.

In currency markets, the dollar gained to 111.67 yen from 109.53 yen on Thursday. The euro fell to $1.1245 from $1.1295.
