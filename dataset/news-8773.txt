The Tony-winning actors Janet McTeer and Liev Schreiber will be the latest scheming aristocrats sparring over love and revenge when a British production of “Les Liaisons Dangereuses” transfers to Broadway.

Producers announced on Monday that a revival of Christopher Hampton’s play will begin performances Oct. 8 and open Oct. 30 at the Booth Theater; it is scheduled to run for 15 weeks.

Ms. McTeer will reprise the role of La Marquise de Merteuil, which she played in the production at the Donmar Warehouse in London; Mr. Schreiber will join the cast as Le Vicomte de Valmont, a role that was played by Dominic West in London.

“Les Liaisons Dangereuses” has been staged on Broadway twice before, in 1987 and 2008. The revival this fall will be directed by Josie Rourke, Donmar’s artistic director. The play is an adaptation of a French 18th-century novel by Choderlos de Laclos; the story was also adapted into a 1988 film, “Dangerous Liaisons,” starring Glenn Close and John Malkovich.

Ms. McTeer won a Tony for her Broadway debut in a revival of “A Doll’s House” in 1997; she has since appeared in “God of Carnage” and “Mary Stuart.” Mr. Schreiber won a Tony award for a revival of “Glengarry Glen Ross” in 2005; he has also appeared on Broadway in “Betrayal,” “Talk Radio” and “A View From the Bridge.”
