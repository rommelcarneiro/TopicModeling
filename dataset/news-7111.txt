It didn’t take long for Brooke Garber Neidich, the daughter of the legendary Chicago jeweler Sidney Garber, to make a name for herself after she began to design jewelry for her father’s eponymous boutique. Her versatile, just-conceptual-enough pieces — in particular, her signature chain bracelet, a stretchy length of articulated gold — made fast fans of powerful women like the Olsen twins. When her father died, she inherited the business, and in 2014 she opened a second shop in New York. Now, she’s expanding her horizons further by introducing a collaboration with the Nigerian-born clothing designer Duro Olowu. To hear the pair tell it, the idea was hatched casually over dinner and carried out almost effortlessly; indeed, the resulting capsule collection is an easy, seamless blend of two aesthetics: Upper East Side meets citizen of the world. “We really have the same taste,” says Olowu, whose drapey printed dresses have their own passionate fan base. They agreed that lapis — a relatively humble, deceptively lightweight blue stone that Olowu describes as luminous and seasonless — should anchor the collection, which includes a chunky ring, sinuous lariats and a bold, studded cuff, all set in gleaming gold and available at Neidich’s Madison Avenue store.
