Victory Dance, the New Victory Theater’s summer series of free performances for New York City students, will return in July with a lineup that includes local favorite companies like David Neumann’s Advanced Beginner Group, the Limón Dance Company and Camille A. Brown & Dancers.

The season runs from July 13 through July 29 and features three programs of dance and talks with educators and artists. Each program will also have one performance for the public, with tickets available for $10.

Mr. Neumann will join Doug Elkins and Annie-B Parson’s Big Dance Theater in Program A (July 13-15). The next week (July 20-22), Program B features Sonali Skandan’s Jiva Dance, as well as the Limón and Lar Lubovitch dance companies. Rounding out the lineup are the American Tap Dance Foundation, Nadine Bommer Dance Company and Ms. Brown’s company in Program C (July 27-29).
