Archaeologists have been combing the ancient city of Petra in southern Jordan for at least two centuries. Now, with drones and satellite imagery, they have discovered new features, including a monumental platform of nearly 30,000 square feet, or roughly half a football field.

Pottery shards nearby date from the second century B.C. through the sixth century A.D.

“It was large, significant given its location, and significant resources were used to construct it,” said Sarah Parcak, a professor of anthropology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. “But its exact function? We don’t know.”
