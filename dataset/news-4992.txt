A bipartisan criminal justice overhaul remains stalled in the Senate. But its backers might have found a new argument to break it loose: It would save a significant amount of money.

The Congressional Budget Office, in a new report, estimated that the legislation reducing mandatory minimum sentences would save the federal government $722 million over 10 years, primarily through reduced costs for housing federal prisoners. Spending on social programs to aid those released would rise $251 million over the same period.

“This bill will make our communities stronger and safer, and save taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars in the process,” Senators Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, and Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, two chief authors of the legislation, said in a joint statement.

Conservatives have consistently championed changes in sentencing laws as a way to reduce the spiraling costs of housing large prison populations. Backers of the legislation no doubt hope that the fiscal responsibility aspect will catch the eye of Senate Republicans who have come out in opposition of the legislation on the grounds that it could set violent offenders free.

Its supporters had hoped to get moving on the bill by May 30. But the Senate is occupied with spending bills, and the criminal justice proposal could not come up until June at the earliest. Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, has given no sign that he will bring the legislation to the floor. He and other Senate Republicans for now appear to prefer focusing on legislation trying to stem a heroin epidemic as a political alternative to the sentencing measure.
