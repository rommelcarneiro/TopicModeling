A reader asks: “Scientific writing talks about dinosaurs as both smart and stupid. So which is it? And how smart is smart anyway in dinosaur terms?”

The New York Times science reporter Kenneth Chang — whose recent article about tyrannosaurs evolving “sophisticated brains” before they became “colossal apex predators” spurred online comparisons with a certain larger-than-life presidential hopeful — considers the question.

First, remember that dinosaurs were a huge group of animals that lived over a huge span of time, more than 150 million years. It’s a gross oversimplification to label them all smart or stupid.

Obviously no one administered I.Q. tests during the Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods, but scientists can make reasonable estimates based on the ratio of body size to brain size.

Bottom line: They weren’t all that smart. Just this week, paleontologists described a long-necked dinosaur as big as two elephants with a brain the size of a lime.

The smartest dinosaurs were about as smart as birds (which, after all, are descendants of dinosaurs), and the smartest dinosaurs then were not as smart as the smartest birds today, such as crows.
