Donald J. Trump’s campaign is adding staff members to key areas it has been criticized for neglecting, bringing on Jim Murphy as its new national political director and preparing to beef up its communications team.

Mr. Murphy, the head of JLM Consulting, was a senior adviser to Bob Dole’s 1988 and 1996 presidential campaigns and managed floor operations at three Republican conventions. Previously, he was president of DCI Group, a public affairs firm.

Mr. Murphy’s hire comes just over a week after the campaign fired Rick Wiley, who held the position previously but was fired after less than two months. And it also comes amid stumbles by Mr. Trump as he and his team try to ramp up to a more robust operation capable of running a multimillion dollar general election campaign.

Mr. Trump and Mr. Murphy spoke by phone over the weekend, and four campaign aides confirmed Mr. Murphy’s hiring.

The campaign has only one person, Hope Hicks, the campaign spokeswoman, overseeing communications, and is hoping to add at least two new hires to help as early as this week.

Mr. Murphy got his start in politics working for Senator Gordon J. Humphrey, Republican of New Hampshire, and also briefly served as deputy political director at the National Republican Senatorial Committee in the mid-1980s.

Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman who also hired Mr. Wiley, helped bring Mr. Murphy on board. Mr. Murphy also worked with Michael Glassner, the Trump deputy campaign manager, on the Dole campaign in 1996, and he is familiar with the campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, from their days working together in New Hampshire. He is also close with Rick Reed, who makes ads for the Trump campaign.
