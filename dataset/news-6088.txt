American stocks surged to their biggest gain in two months on Tuesday after the Chinese government moved to stimulate its economy. That gave a boost to energy, chemicals and machinery companies.

For months, investors have worried about the state of China’s economy, which is the world’s second-largest after that of the United States. The prospect of greater sales to China lifted companies that make basic building materials, chemicals, aircraft, and building and mining equipment.

The price of oil matched a six-month high, and companies that drill for oil and refine it also rose. All 10 industrial sectors of the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index finished higher.

Investors have been taking money out of stocks lately, said Bob Doll, chief equity strategist and senior portfolio manager at Nuveen Asset Management. “It’s just another small step on the way of China attempting to address the issue,” he said. “This is a ray of sunshine which is needed.”

The S.&P. 500 gained 25.70 points, or 1.3 percent, to 2,084.39. The Nasdaq composite index rose 59.67 points, or 1.3 percent, to 4,809.88.

The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 222.44 points, or 1.3 percent, to 17,928.35.

Economic news from the United States was mixed. The Labor Department said job openings in March rose by the largest amount in eight months, but hiring slowed. The agency said job openings grew 2.7 percent to about 5.8 million.

Amazon’s shares reached a nominal high after it started a self-publishing video platform called Video Direct. The move could make money for Amazon and budding filmmakers in the way YouTube has created a community of online celebrities. Amazon climbed $23.32, or 3.4 percent, to $703.07.

Stocks overseas mostly traded higher. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 added 2.2 percent as the yen weakened, a boon for the nation’s exporters. The dollar rose to 109.27 yen from 108.38 yen. The dollar has lost a bit of strength compared to the yen in recent months.

Germany’s DAX and Britain’s FTSE 100 both gained 0.7 percent and the CAC 40 in France added 0.4 percent.

Bond yields were stable and the yield on the 10-year United States Treasury note stayed at 1.75 percent. The euro declined to $1.1367 from $1.1380.

United States crude oil rose $1.22, or 2.8 percent, to $44.66 a barrel in New York, the highest price in six months. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil prices, gained $1.89, or 4.3 percent, to $45.52 a barrel in London.

In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline gained 4 cents, or 3 percent, to $1.49 a gallon. Natural gas rose 6 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $2.16 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Gold fell $1.80 to $1,264.80 an ounce.
