A 94th-minute penalty rescued a point for the Czech Republic in its 2-2 draw with Croatia as flares were thrown onto the pitch during a Euro 2016 match in St.-Étienne, France.

With Croatia leading by 2-1 and with one foot in the last 16, the referee Mark Clattenberg briefly halted play late in the game when flares thrown by Croatian fans landed on the field.

When the match resumed, Croatia defender Domagoj Vida was penalized for a handball, and Tomas Necid drilled home the resulting penalty, deep in added time, to claim the Czech team’s first point in Group D.

UEFA, soccer’s governing body in Europe, could impose further sanctions on the Croatian Football Federation for the crowd trouble.

“These people are terrorists, they are not fans,” Croatia Coach Ante Cacic said.
