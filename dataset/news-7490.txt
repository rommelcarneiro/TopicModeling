A white powder that was discovered at the campaign office of Donald J. Trump at the Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan on Thursday night was not a threat, the authorities said.

The Police Department said it was called around 7:30 p.m. to the fifth floor of the tower, at Fifth Avenue and 56th Street, for a report of an envelope containing white powder. Mr. Trump’s home is also in the building.

The envelope had been mailed to Mr. Trump’s campaign office, where a staff member opened it and immediately called the police, The Associated Press reported.

The police said early on Friday morning that the powder was deemed to be safe, though investigators were still determining what exactly it was. The situation was declared under control around 11:10 p.m., the Fire Department said.

The police said four people, including a police officer, had been evaluated. The authorities had previously reported that six people were being evaluated.

A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, referred inquiries to the United States Secret Service. A press officer at the agency was not immediately available to comment on Thursday night.

Mr. Trump was campaigning in California that night.

In March, the authorities investigated a letter containing a nonhazardous white powder that was sent to the Manhattan apartment of one of Mr. Trump’s sons, Eric.
