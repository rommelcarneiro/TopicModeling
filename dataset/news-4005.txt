At long last, the epic court fight between Oracle and Google is … still not over.

On Thursday, a federal jury in San Francisco found that Google did not violate Oracle-owned copyrights in the creation of Android, its world-dominating mobile phone operating system.

The code at the heart of this court fight, which has been going on for six years, is Java, a programming language Oracle acquired when it bought a once-dominant Silicon Valley company called Sun Microsystems.

Java, developed by Sun engineers, was considered a landmark programming language and it played a prominent role in the development of software and websites during the dot-com boom. It was also an important component of Android, and Google argues that it didn’t need to pay Sun to use it since Java was governed by an open-source license.

Not so fast, Oracle has been arguing since 2010. For the second time, a jury has sided with Google. But the fight isn’t over: Oracle says it will appeal.
