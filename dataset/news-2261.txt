I’m grateful for the hospitality, but my mother-in-law insists on divulging personal information at inappropriate times; she once showed me a pelvic rash while I was eating. Please order her to desist! P.S.: It would be lovely to see you in Australia.

Yes, your mother-in-law is gross. This is not a column of etiquette, however, but of fake law that I make up in my head. And here is the law: When adult children are sponging off parents — and especially in-laws — the folks who pay the bills can live and talk in whatever disgusting way they like. When you have your own home, you can make your own rules about rashes. Until then: Convert faster. P.S.: I would love to see you in Australia. Wait till you see my rickets!
