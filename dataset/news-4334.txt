One of the “super PACs” supporting Donald J. Trump said Tuesday that it was hiring former aides to Rudolph W. Giuliani and George E. Pataki to advise the group as it seeks to raise money.

Great America PAC is bringing aboard Jake Menges, a longtime adviser to Mr. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, and Rob Cole, a veteran adviser to Mr. Pataki, the former governor of New York. Mr. Cole was also an adviser to the Mitt Romney presidential effort in 2008.

The pair will join Edward J. Rollins, a veteran Republican strategist. Officials with the group approached Mr. Giuliani several weeks ago about the possibility of hosting events, and they hope to be able to deploy him in the coming months.
