Septeto Santiaguero, a Latin Grammy-winning group from Cuba, will make its United States debut as part of this year’s Midsummer Night Swing, Lincoln Center’s annual outdoor dance party series.

The season, which runs from June 21 through July 9, also features an array of performers from different genres like salsa, disco, tango — and, of course, swing. As in recent years there will also be late-night silent discos.

Septeto Santiaguero, a favorite of the nightclub Casa de la Trova in Cuba, has its debut on June 28, with a blend of traditional and experimental music. The performance, like others throughout Midsummer Night Swing, will be preceded by an optional dance lesson to warm up attendees.

Other highlights from the season include the opening-night concert by the swing and blues group Catherine Russell Septet, led by Ms. Russell, daughter of Louis Armstrong’s longtime orchestra director Luis Russell and the bassist Carline Ray. On June 25 the Allen Toussaint Band pays tribute to its namesake, the New Orleans musician who died last year. That program includes the singer Irma Thomas, one of Mr. Toussaint’s collaborators.

The silent discos, which have become a fixture of Midsummer Night Swing in the past few years, are scheduled for June 23 and July 2. The parties, which begin at 10 p.m., feature a lineup of D.J.’s who perform live sets for wireless headphones.
