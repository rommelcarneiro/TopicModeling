The dominant theme in the technology industry for more than a few years now has been social media and on-demand services. Facebook and Twitter. Uber and Airbnb. And a whole lot of other companies that have come and gone or are still going strong.

What’s missing from the equation is a demonstrable improvement in overall productivity, as Steve Lohr writes. The productivity question has split economists. Some argue that the tech industry simply isn’t creating tools that help workers work more effectively. Others believe that recent trends like artificial intelligence and big data analysis are too new to have had much of an impact.

The tech industry has been chock-full of productivity-improving creations, of course, from the personal computer itself to spreadsheets, databases, word processors and browsers. It could be a matter of time before newer technologies have a similar impact.

It also wouldn’t be going out on a limb to wonder if goofing around on social media sites actually hampers productivity.
