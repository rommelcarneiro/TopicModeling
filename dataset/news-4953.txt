LONDON — Greenpeace activists scaled the columns in front of the British Museum on Thursday morning, attaching and then unfurling banners that protested the oil company BP’s sponsorship of a new exhibition, “Sunken Cities, Egypt’s Lost Worlds.” The museum was closed until 2 p.m., “to ensure the safety of the museum’s visitors,” a spokeswoman said in an email. Eleven people were arrested in connection with trespassing.

There have been protests against other BP-sponsored exhibitions at the museum, including “Shakespeare: Staging the World” in 2012, and “Vikings: Life and Legend” in 2014, but this was the first time the museum had to close.

The protest follows another made by the theatrical group “BP or not BP” on Tuesday evening during a V.I.P. reception for “Sunken Cities,” which displays artifacts from two lost Egyptian cities buried under the sea.

In a statement reported by the BBC, a spokesman for Greenpeace said that the organization was taking a stand “because of the irony of an oil company sponsoring an exhibition whose name practically spells out impacts of climate change. What were they thinking?”

Greenpeace said that 85 people took part in the British Museum protest in which banners were revealed showing the names of cities threatened by climate change, and renaming the exhibition “Sinking Cities.”

In March, BP announced that it would end its sponsorship of the Tate museums, where it has been a major financial donor for 20 years, in 2017. There too, protesters regularly objected to the sponsorship but the oil company said that it was ending the arrangement for financial reasons.

In a statement the British Museum said that it was “grateful to BP for their long-term support which has allowed the museum to bring world cultures to a global audience through hugely popular exhibitions and their associated public programmes.”
