Attorney General Bill Schuette of Michigan said he would make a “significant announcement” on Wednesday in the state’s investigation into the water contamination crisis in Flint.

Mr. Schuette, who announced in January that he was opening an inquiry into the failed water system that exposed residents to elevated levels of lead, has scheduled a news conference on Wednesday in Flint. He is expected to appear there with top investigators and prosecutors in the case. A spokeswoman for Mr. Schuette, a Republican, declined to say what he would announce or whether the investigation was complete.

Ari Adler, a spokesman for Gov. Rick Snyder, who has faced intense criticism over his handling of the water crisis, said his office had not been given any information from the attorney general’s office.

The state has faced scrutiny for months after Flint switched its water supply and failed to use protective chemicals that prevent leaching of lead from pipes.

A state task force appointed by the governor blamed state officials, including the Department of Environmental Quality, saying they took a lax approach to enforcement and responded to concerns about the water by belittling people who complained.

The Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Justice have also announced investigations into possible violations.

Separately, a class-action lawsuit over Flint’s water was dismissed on Tuesday. A federal judge found that constitutional claims made by residents who brought the suit were banned by the federal Safe Drinking Water Act.
