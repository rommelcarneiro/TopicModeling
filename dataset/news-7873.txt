LAKERS’ COACHING SEARCH Los Angeles Lakers General Manager Mitch Kupchak does not think his search for a new coach will take a long time.

Kupchak told the team’s official television network Monday that he has a large list of candidates to be the Lakers’ fourth full-time coach since 2011, but expects to narrow the field quickly.

“I think it’s unlikely there will be anything done in the next week or two,” Kupchak said on Time Warner Cable SportsNet. “But certainly I don’t anticipate this dragging into the summer. We’d like to get it done.”

The Lakers fired Byron Scott on Sunday night after the two worst seasons in the franchise’s history. Los Angeles went 38-126 under Scott, including 17-65 in Kobe Bryant’s farewell year.

Kupchak did not name any candidates for the job, but he is quite familiar with the Golden State assistant coach Luke Walton, already a popular candidate among Lakers fans. Walton was a Lakers forward for nine seasons before becoming an assistant in their organization and briefly a broadcaster on their network.
