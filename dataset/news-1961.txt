The Board of Regents, New York State’s highest education authority, voted on Monday to make it easier for some students with disabilities to graduate from high school.

Under a new regulation, students with individualized education plans would need to pass two Regents exams — English and math — rather than five. They would still have to take three other exams, in social studies, science and one optional subject, but if they did not pass, their district superintendent could still grant them a diploma if they demonstrated proficiency in those subjects through coursework. The students would not receive the more-rigorous Regents diplomas, but would receive local diplomas, which are accepted by colleges, the military and employers. These students would have to achieve scores of 55 or higher on the English and math exams, or successfully appeal scores of 52 to 54.

Schools start administering Regents exams on Tuesday, and the regulation will take effect immediately. The chancellor of the Board of Regents, Betty A. Rosa, said in an interview that the State Education Department estimated the change would help 1,300 to 2,000 students graduate this year.

Ms. Rosa, who was elected chancellor in March, has criticized what she has called an overemphasis on standardized tests in evaluating both students and teachers. She said on Monday that the Regents were going to take a broad look at the state’s graduation requirements. Asked if they might decide to let students without disabilities show proficiency through coursework, she said it was too early to say.

The Regents also voted on Monday to allow school districts to apply for a waiver to a requirement in the state’s teacher evaluation law that teachers and principals be observed by independent evaluators as well as their direct supervisors. The requirement could be waived if the districts can show that compliance would cause financial hardship, among other conditions.
