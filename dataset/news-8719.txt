New York City announced plans on Monday to combat the spread of Zika virus, a largely mosquito-borne disease that has spread rapidly in the Western Hemisphere and raised concern that it may cause birth defects in infants if their mothers are infected during pregnancy.

The city’s plans are based on a health department program to combat the spread of West Nile virus, a relative of Zika that is also spread by mosquitoes, the office of Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement.

“We will spare no effort to protect pregnant New Yorkers from the devastating consequences of Zika, and we ask New Yorkers to help us by taking simple steps to get rid of standing water where mosquitoes can breed,” Mr. de Blasio said in the statement. “We also ask pregnant women who may have been exposed to Zika to talk to their doctors about getting tested.”

The city’s plans include a campaign to spread testing and prevention information in the five boroughs, an expansion of mosquito surveillance programs to go after insects that may carry the disease, and testing services for pregnant New Yorkers and local mosquitoes.

The city and state will invest $21 million in the anti-Zika effort over the next three years, which will include doubling the number of mosquito traps in the city and hiring 51 new employees, including inspectors, exterminators, disease inspectors and lab analysts.

Zika virus is spread through mosquito bites as well as through sexual contact. Most people experience no symptoms and no lasting harm, but research suggests it may cause microcephaly — unusually small heads and often damaged brains — in babies whose mothers were infected during pregnancy.
