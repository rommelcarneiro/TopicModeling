It’s up to Facebook to bring some light to what has been a dark and stormy tech earnings season.

The world’s biggest social network is scheduled to report quarterly results on Wednesday, and it is projected to post strong revenue growth and continued additions to its user base. Fueled by its robust financial performance, Facebook has huge ambitions: Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s chief executive, recently laid out more of his vision for connecting the world, including a bigger emphasis on messaging services like Facebook Messenger.

A strong display of financial might from Facebook would stand in stark contrast to what has been a dismal series of earnings reports from the tech industry’s largest companies over the last 10 days. IBM, Intel, Microsoft and Alphabet, the parent company of Google, all posted weaker-than-expected results because of a variety of factors: Some of the companies were struggling with the shift away from PCs to mobile, while others were grappling with outsize expectations.

Just how poor this tech earnings season has been was crystallized on Tuesday. That’s when Apple, the world’s most valuable public company, announced its first-ever year-over-year decline of iPhone sales, as well as its first year-over-year revenue drop since 2003, Vindu Goel writes.

Twitter added to the carnage with an earnings report showing that not only had its user growth remained modest, but revenue growth was also not as robust as Wall Street had hoped, Mike Isaac writes. Apple and Twitter’s stocks both plummeted in after-hours trading.
