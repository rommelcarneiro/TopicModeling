The Ford Foundation, other philanthropic groups and some private donors have given nearly $20 million to United States Artists, an organization that makes grants to artists.

“Artists can drive social change by inspiring our imaginations and challenging us all to work toward a better world,” the Ford Foundation’s president, Darren Walker, said in a statement on Monday.

The money will serve as an operational endowment to support United States Artists’ staffing, conferences and the cultivation of nominators and the administration of grants, among other things. It will cover everything except the grants to the artists themselves, which are financed separately.

“The administrative process of managing the awards is extremely rigorous, which is why this operations endowment allows us to be more nimble and innovative,” said Carolina Garcia Jayaram, the chief executive of United States Artists.

The group said that it would use this latest endowment to continue awarding unrestricted $50,000 fellowships to accomplished artists in disciplines like architecture and design, dance, literature, music, theater and visual arts.

United States Artists said a $10 million gift is coming from the Ford Foundation, plus $1 million grants from the Rockefeller Foundation, the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. Additional contributions are coming in from individual donors.

United States Artists, established 11 years ago, has given out more than $21 million to support nearly 450 artists.
