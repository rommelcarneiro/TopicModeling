There’s no shortage of full-throated Republican endorsements of Donald J. Trump. But there are several Republican leaders who haven’t exactly swooned when describing their support of the presumptive presidential nominee.

Those who are more hesitant speak loudly through their softer statements. They share a few common sentiments: No matter their opinions of Mr. Trump, they believe that Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, would be much, much worse. Some said they would support the Republican nominee no matter what. Some said they would “support” but not “endorse” Mr. Trump.

Here’s a collection of some of the verbal contortions and justifications this year, when it became clear Mr. Trump was on his way to locking up the nomination.
