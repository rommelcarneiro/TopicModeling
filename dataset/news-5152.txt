Last week, the stylist Elizabeth Stewart found herself running down the Croisette, the long promenade in Cannes, between Julia Roberts’s hotel room and Jessica Chastain’s. As the stylist to both stars during the Cannes Film Festival, which ends May 22, Stewart says she prepared outfits for several events — not to mention countless backup dresses and options for last-minute appearances that get on her clients’ schedules. “It’s all about being ready for any scenario,” she says.

One such unexpected moment: As Julia Roberts ascended the grand staircase for her film premiere, wearing a custom Armani Privé dress, she kicked off her heels. Following the event, headlines screamed “Julia Roberts Went Barefoot on the Cannes Red Carpet” — which Stewart laughs about now. “She was not barefoot,” Stewart says. “She got worried about going up the steps, kicked off her shoes just to go up the steps, but it was much photographed. She put her shoes on right at the top of the stairs.” She adds: “I thought it was really funny.”

In the slide show above, Stewart gives T an exclusive look inside her trip to the Cannes Film Festival, including countless hair and makeup sessions, a premiere — and some good fish.
