LONDON — Amundi, one of the largest asset managers in Europe, said on Monday that it had agreed to acquire a majority stake in the Irish institutional asset manager Kleinwort Benson Investors from the French financial services company Oddo & Cie.

Amundi, which went public in November, said it would acquire an 87.5 percent stake in Kleinwort Benson Investors, while the remaining 12.5 percent would be owned by the management of the Irish company.

Terms of the transaction were not made public.

Based in Dublin, Kleinwort Benson Investors had 7.6 billion euros, or about $8.5 billion, in assets under management as of the end of March. The company, which also has offices in Boston and New York, reported revenue of €31 million in 2015.

Sean Hawkshaw would continue to serve as the chief executive of Kleinwort Benson Investors, and Noel O’Halloran would remain as chief investment officer.

The transaction is subject to regulatory approval, and it is expected to close in the third quarter.

The deal by Oddo & Cie comes after it made a takeover bid for the company’s parent, BHF Kleinwort Benson Group, in November and acquired the business this year.

Oddo & Cie agreed to sell the British and Channel Islands wealth management businesses of BHF Kleinwort Benson Group to Société Générale in March.

Amundi, based in Paris, was created in 2010 by a merger of the asset management operations of two French banks, Crédit Agricole and Société Générale. It had €987 billion in assets under management as of the end of March.

Sandler O’Neill advised Oddo & Cie on the transaction.
