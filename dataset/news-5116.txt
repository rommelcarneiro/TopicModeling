Facebook keeps trying to take the air out of allegations that it is anti-conservative. Its latest attempt is happening on Wednesday.

That’s when the social network is scheduled to hold a meeting with leading Republican pundits and politicians to walk them through how it decides which articles to show on a news feature called Trending Topics. The meeting was convened by Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, and its highest-ranking Republican executive, Joel Kaplan, the company’s vice president for global public policy, along with about a dozen conservatives.

Facebook is trying to bat down concerns that it suppressed conservative articles in Trending Topics, accusations that appeared in a report on Gizmodo last week and that have since fueled a reaction against the social network. Facebook has tried several times to reassure people it is neutral — including by publishing its internal editorial guidelines and in a post from Mr. Zuckerberg.

That the controversy continues illustrates how difficult it is for Facebook to dissociate itself from a liberal image fostered by Mr. Zuckerberg and other top executives, writes Cecilia Kang. It’s an especially tough task facing Mr. Kaplan, who was brought on board for his conservative credentials and to counterbalance the left-leaning perceptions of the company.

There’s another summit meeting taking place on Wednesday by a different tech giant — but that one involves developers, not politicians. Google is holding its annual developer conference, the first one since it evolved into a holding company unit under a parent called Alphabet. As David Streitfeld reports, one of the announcements that Google plans to make at the conference is its own voice-activated home device called Google Home.
