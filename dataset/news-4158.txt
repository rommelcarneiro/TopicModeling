Good evening. Here’s the latest.

1. President Obama and other G-7 leaders meeting in Japan made a side trip to the Ise Shrine, considered the country’s holiest site. Mr. Obama said he decided to take the historic step of visiting Hiroshima on Friday as a way to remind the world of the dangers of nuclear weapons. And he told reporters that his fellow world leaders were “rattled” by the political ascendance of Donald Trump.

2. Mr. Trump chose an an oil industry conference in North Dakota to make his first policy speech on energy and the environment. His priorities: rejecting the Paris climate agreement to focus on “real environmental problems” like water pollution, and working to “free up coal” to help make the U.S. independent of Opec. “America’s incredible energy potential remains untapped,” he said.

3. Bernie Sanders, buoyed by polls showing he’d have a better chance of defeating Mr. Trump than Hillary Clinton would, persuaded Mr. Trump to consider a debate ahead of California’s primary June 7. In California, a poll showed that Mrs. Clinton’s lead over Mr. Sanders had evaporated. That’s tough news for her at a time when the Sanders side is finding more ammunition in new scrutiny of her State Department-era email. And Democratic attempts to create a unifying platform are faltering, as Sanders supporters urge the party to take a more critical stance on Israel.

4. The regular season’s superstars, the Golden State Warriors, survived what just a week ago seemed unthinkable: They were on the verge of elimination against the Oklahoma City Thunder. The Warriors’ 120-111 victory kept the series going.

5. A Times special report examines Mexico’s armed forces and their staggering kill rates. Officials say their soldiers are simply better fighters than the cartels they take on, but experts see something more ominous in figures showing four times or more the usual ratio of dead to injured. “They are summary executions,” said a retired New York University professor who pioneered the study of lethality among armed forces.

_____

6. Ken Starr, the former independent prosecutor who pursued President Bill Clinton through scandals in the ’90s, was removed as president of Baylor University. An investigation found that his administration mishandled reports of sexual assaults by some of the university’s football players. The head coach, Art Briles, was fired. “We were horrified by the extent of these acts of sexual violence on our campus,” the board of regents’ chairman said. Mr. Starr, above at a game last fall, will remain as chancellor.

_____

7. A sad mystery in Maine was solved. Officials released a vast file on a case that set off one of the biggest search missions in state history: a 66-year-old retired nurse who disappeared on a solo hike in 2013 and whose remains were found last year. Her diary shows that she kept herself alive for a month after losing her way — and that she came to accept that help would not come in time.

_____

8. When the Obamas leave the White House, they’ll move just two miles, according to people briefed on their plans. And the digs are on the magnificent side: an 8,200-square-foot, nine-bedroom mansion in the capital’s upscale Kalorama neighborhood. The Obamas are expected to stay until Sasha finishes high school in 2018.

_____

9. Louisiana changed its hate-crime law to protect a new group: law enforcement officers. Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat with many officers in his family line, signed what some call the “Blue Lives Matter” bill. It comes as federal data show violence against police officers near a record low.

_____

10. This Memorial Day Weekend rings in the summer travel season with the lowest gasoline prices in a 11 years. But oil prices have been creeping back up, and briefly hit $50 a barrel for the first time since November.

_____

11. Finally, meet Koshik, South Korea’s talking elephant. Well, not exactly. The 26-year-old Asian male changes the tone and pitch of his utterances by moving his trunk inside his mouth, parroting five Korean words or phrases he hears often from keepers: hello, sit down, lie down, good and, of course, no.
