In this week’s episode of the Modern Love Podcast, the actor Joshua Jackson (“The Affair,” “Dawson’s Creek”) reads Joshua Fattal’s 2014 essay, “Reaching Out Between the Bars.” Mr. Fattal was one of three Americans, along with Shane Bauer and Sarah Shourd, who were detained in Iran for 26 months after unknowingly crossing over an unmarked border of Iraqi Kurdistan into Iranian Kurdistan during a hiking trip in 2009.

You can also hear the episode on iTunes and Stitcher.

Upon returning home, Mr. Fattal reunited with his middle-school girlfriend, Jenny. This is the story of their relationship.

Afterward, Mr. Fattal will talk about life since the column was published.
