Two superstar Chinese pianists of the same generation but with quite different personalities, Lang Lang, 33, and Yuja Wang, 29, come to Carnegie Hall this week. On Wednesday, May 11, Mr. Lang, who combines stupendous technique with theatrical flair, is soloist with the Philadelphia Orchestra, conducted by its dynamic music director Yannick Nézet-Séguin, playing Rachmaninoff’s less-heard, youthful First Concerto. After intermission, Mr. Nézet-Séguin conducts Mahler’s Symphony No. 10 in Deryck Cooke’s much-debated performing edition that includes the British scholar’s completion of the last three movements, which were left in sketchy states by the composer.

Ms. Wang, who has comparable brilliance along with taste and lucid musicality, appears in recital at the hall on Saturday. She offers a substantive and serious program, with two Brahms Ballades, Schumann’s fantastical “Kreisleriana” suite and Beethoven’s mighty “Hammerklavier” Sonata. (212-247-7800; carnegiehall.org.)
