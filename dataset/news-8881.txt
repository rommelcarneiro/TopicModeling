On Saturday night, Guns N’ Roses brought out the AC/DC guitarist Angus Young at Coachella. Soon, the exchange will be reversed: Axl Rose, the Guns N’ Roses lead singer, will take up frontman duties for AC/DC on its world tour next month.

He will take the place of Brian Johnson, who stopped touring after being advised by doctors that he could lose his hearing completely if he continued. “As much as we want this tour to end as it started, we understand, respect and support Brian’s decision to stop touring and save his hearing,” the band wrote in a statement on Saturday. The tour will begin on May 7 in Lisbon and end in June in Denmark. Ten AC/DC shows that were postponed in the United States are also slated to be rescheduled, with Mr. Rose singing lead.

Mr. Rose will return for a three-month reunion tour with Guns N’ Roses, in a lineup that features two of the group’s other founding members, Slash and Duff McKagan. “There is more self-preservation in his performance; he allows himself some clear-voiced high crooning and saves his most throat-tearing howls for peak moments,” Jon Pareles wrote about Mr. Rose in his recent review in The New York Times.
