The prominent gallery Hauser & Wirth in September will take over the former four-story Dia Art Foundation space on West 22nd Street as a temporary home while constructing its new building on a site next door.

“We are thrilled to be in this strongly historic space which was kind of the birthplace of contemporary art in Chelsea,” said Marc Payot, a partner and vice president at Hauser & Wirth.

To adapt the space, the gallery has enlisted Annabelle Selldorf, who is also the architect of Hauser & Wirth’s new building, at 542 West 22nd Street, which begins construction this summer and is expected to open in the first half of 2018.

The gallery’s final show in its current temporary space, at 511 West 18th Street (the former Roxy disco), will be a Paul McCarthy exhibition, which opens in November.

Hauser & Wirth will continue to operate its first New York location on the Upper East Side.
