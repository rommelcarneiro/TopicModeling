The possibility that Donald J. Trump and Bernie Sanders could meet in a debate got us thinking. Creatively.

ANDERSON COOPER: Welcome to a CNN special presentation; I’m Anderson Cooper. Tonight, we have an unusual showdown: Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. Mr. Trump, you won 12 consecutive coin-tosses backstage somehow, so you’ll have the chance to speak first.

DONALD J. TRUMP: Heads I win, tails you lose. I make deals, O.K.? [Mr. Sanders grimaces.]

Thank you, CNN, for having me and you’re welcome, CNN, for having me. We’re gonna make a little money here, O.K.? Some beautiful charities. So what is there to say? Bernie’s done great, right? He’s taking it to Crooked Hillary. Big crowds. Yuge. Second biggest, easy. I’m not gonna say who’s got the biggest. John Miller tells me it’s me. I’m not gonna say it.

COOPER: All right. Senator Sanders, your response.

BERNIE SANDERS: Thank you, Anderson, I’ll be blunt. To elect a demagogue, a BILLIONAIRE, who has had his hands ALL OVAH a corrupt Wall Street system that —

TRUMP: Hands, huh? Look at this tough guy now, Anderson. Hands. [Raises hands skyward, as if celebrating a touchdown or attempting to frighten a bear.] You see any problem with these hands?

SANDERS: The AMERICAN PEOPLE are SICK AND TIRED of hearing about ya DAMN HANDS.

TRUMP: It’s O.K., he’s having a rough night. Real tough guy, Crazy Bernie.

SANDERS: The AMERICAN PEOPLE have had a lot of rough nights, Anderson. A LOT of rough nights, under a corrupt system of —

TRUMP: Not too many tough guys come out of Vermont, O.K.? Not too many killers.

[Crowd begins to boo.]

O.K., here we go. The donors got tickets again. Lotta maple syrup money in the room. Here it is. Real tough. Kasich can bring the pancakes. Big, tough guys.

SANDERS: It is a KNOWN FACT that the top 5 percent of the top 1 percent of the pancake —

TRUMP: Look at this guy sweat. You seeing this guy? It’s like Liddle Marco in a parka at Mar-a-Lago. Disgusting.

SANDERS: Anderson, I’d like to remind EVERYONE here of what really matters. We must not elect this dangerous man as our president. Now let me say a word about my Democratic opponent. We have had our differences, but I respect Secretary Clinton. She knows her way around a superdelegate. She is a smart, decent, capable representative of the corrupt Washington establishment.

COOPER: Is that all?

SANDERS: You’ll hear the rest in Philly, Anderson.

COOPER: O.K., I want to ask you both about your tax returns. Now, a lot of voters have criticized you both for — Gentlemen? Are you still with us? You do realize we can see you ducking under the lecterns?

TRUMP: [whispering into a live microphone] I’m the best hider, he can’t see us.

COOPER: O.K., let’s try another one. Higher education. Senator Sanders, you have promised free tuition for all.

TRUMP: Trump University will not be a part of that, Anderson. We’re getting paid, O.K.?

COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump. What is the status of the Trump University lawsuits, sir?

TRUMP: Let me tell you something about Jeb Bush, all right?

COOPER: Sir, I think Governor Bush has suffered enough.

[Trump supporters begin to protest. A robust “Trump!” chant builds. Mr. Trump joins them.]

TRUMP: Trump! Trump! Trump!

[Mr. Sanders retrieves an old boombox, holding it aloft. Simon and Garfunkel croon from the speakers: “They’ve all come to look for Amerrrrr-ica.”]

TRUMP: Ben and Jerry play instruments?

COOPER: We’ll be right back.
