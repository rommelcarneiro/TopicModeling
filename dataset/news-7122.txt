An article on Wednesday about the Mets’ 4-3 victory over the Cincinnati Reds misidentified, in some copies, the position of Wally Pipp, the Yankee usurped by Lou Gehrig who was cited by Mets Manager Terry Collins when discussing catcher Travis d’Arnaud’s injury. Pipp was a first baseman, not an outfielder.

Because of an editing error, an Associated Press report in the N.H.L. roundup last Monday about the Dallas Stars’ 5-4 victory over the Minnesota Wild that ended their first-round N.H.L. playoff series misstated the year the Stars last advanced to the second round. It was 2008, not 1998.

THE ARTS

A music review on Wednesday about the Argento Chamber Ensemble, at Zankel Hall in Manhattan, referred incorrectly to the composer Beat Furrer’s reciting of a poem in “Xenos III,” an excerpt from his opera “Wüstenbuch” (“Desert Book”). He recited the text live; his voice was not recorded.

OBITUARIES

Because of an editing error, an obituary on Thursday about the longtime Jets offensive lineman Winston Hill misstated the name of the all-star pro football team to which he was named eight times. It is the All-Pro team, not the All-Star team.
