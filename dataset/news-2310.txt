Surfing is in, at least for travelers. More people are signing up for surf camps, and resorts are starting to give guests a chance to catch a wave. Four are below.

Witch’s Rock Surf Camp on Costa Rica’s northwest coast was founded in 2001, but it says its number of students has jumped over 40 percent the last two years. The school has programs for first-time and experienced surfers ranging from two-hour lessons to a weeklong immersion (from $45 a person).

Richard Schmidt Surf School in Santa Cruz, Calif., about 90 minutes south of San Francisco, offers year-round surfing and has gentle waves ideal for beginners. Small group two-hour sessions run throughout the year ($90), and five-night surf camps are an option in the summer. They include four to six hours of daily surf instruction, daily yoga classes, all meals and accommodations ($1,200 a person).

For women only, Las Olas Surf Safaris in Nayarit, Mexico, has five-night getaways running select weeks from November through June. Surfing classes, twice-daily yoga sessions, some meals, a massage, equipment and accommodations are included (from $2,695 a person).

And Memmo Baleeira, on Portugal’s Algarve Coast, has surf packages ranging from two to seven nights; they include accommodations, instruction, equipment rental, some meals and excursions to nearby surf sites (from $155).
