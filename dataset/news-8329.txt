Few people in the English-speaking world could have been happier on April 23, 1916, than the readers of The New York Times.

That was the day our 10-part William Shakespeare supplement, marking the 300th anniversary of his death, finally came to an end. It had begun in February and taken up 43 large pages of the Sunday paper with 75,000 words (give or take a few thousand) and nearly 200 illustrations.

“This was one of the most exhaustive retrospectives The Times could ever hope to accomplish on a single subject and accounted for some gorgeous pages,” said Ryan Murphy, who works in The Times’s photo archive.

Beautiful as it was, could anyone possibly have consumed it all?

Even The Times — in the magisterial voice of its drama critic, Alexander Woollcott — conceded that the popular appeal of Shakespeare was shrinking fast. The “naturalistic” school had taken hold. This was the year Eugene O’Neill’s “Bound East for Cardiff” was first performed.

“The great Elizabethan is now speaking to a polite but alien house,” Mr. Woollcott wrote. “You realize that now, as never before in the three centuries since his death, great inherent difficulties beset in the theater the message from his heart to ours.”

Yet it’s not difficult to understand why The Times decided to lavish so much effort on the series. We gave our strategy away in an advertisement for the supplements.

“In practically every large city of the country there are to be during this year community plays, masques, festivals, pageants, tableaux and other forms of celebration,” the copy read. “The New York Times Shakespeare Series is planned to be not only of interest to the average cultured individual, but of great help to the groups participating in these celebrations, and particularly to university, college and high school classes studying Shakespeare.”

That was a huge audience whose money we were not going to leave on the table.

Reaching around the pay wall, The Times offered this accommodation: “Persons not regular subscribers to The New York Times may procure all of the installments to the series by subscribing for the 10 Sunday issues containing this series at the regular price of the complete Sunday Times, at 5 cents the issue, or 50 cents for the 10 issues, post paid.”

For their half dollars, subscribers received sumptuous supplements led by these essays:

• “The World Today Commemorates the Great Life that Ended 300 Years Ago,” Feb. 20.

• “Shakespeare the Great Creator of Tragedy,” by Richard Le Gallienne, Feb. 27.

• “Shakespeare’s Heroines as Human Beings,” by Charlotte Perkins Gilman, March 5.

• “Odds Against Shakespeare on Stage Today,” by Mr. Woollcott, March 12.

• “Shakespeare and the Sea,” by Alfred Noyes, March 19.

• “How Each Age Finds New Flaws in Shakespeare,” by John Palmer, March 26.

• “The English Theater in Shakespeare’s Time,” by Ashley H. Thorndike, April 2.

• “He Divined Life, He Did Not Merely Copy It,” by Sir Sidney Lee, April 9.

• “He Conquered France but Slowly,” by Joseph L. Borgerhoff, April 16.

• “Shakespeare’s Comedy a Growth,” by Martin W. Sampson, April 23.

Nothing remotely equivalent has been planned for the 400th anniversary, a fact that Mr. Woollcott could have predicted a century ago.

“Every development in the modern theater, not only in the drama, but in the structure of the buildings and the mechanism of the world behind the scenes, gives aid to the will and power to pretend,” he wrote. “The imagination is subvened in the playhouse today. It has been pampered and Shakespeare is a strain upon it. There is the heart of the matter.”
