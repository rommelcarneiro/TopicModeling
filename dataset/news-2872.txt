For several decades, Sumner M. Redstone ran his media empire with forceful, fiery and sometimes fear-inducing resolve. Whether he was heatedly pursuing an acquisition or churning through chief executives, there was never much doubt about what he wanted.

Now, however, Mr. Redstone, 93 and frail, is sequestered in his Beverly Hills mansion. He has not been seen publicly in more than a year. In conference calls with his companies, he remains silent for long periods, and a recent court case showed that his speech was erratic and his words sometimes incomprehensible.

As a result, Mr. Redstone’s wishes, currently at the center of a bitter legal dispute, are being conveyed to his corporate executives, and to the public, through a new team of representatives acting on his behalf as he reorganizes his $40 billion media empire.

These new lieutenants are unknown to many of Mr. Redstone’s longtime confidants at Viacom, the big entertainment company he controls. Their sudden appearance has become an issue in the challenge Viacom directors have mounted because of the recent changes at the top of his companies; some have questioned whether a new lawyer and a new spokesman acting on Mr. Redstone’s behalf have even met with him, suggesting that they are actually acting at the behest of his daughter, Shari Redstone.

In court filings, the directors asserted that the lawyer, Michael C. Tu, was “purporting to act” on Mr. Redstone’s behalf.

An opening hearing is scheduled on Tuesday in Massachusetts for a lawsuit challenging Mr. Redstone’s competency and asserting that he has been manipulated by Ms. Redstone. Two crucial questions set the backdrop for the legal battle: Who is speaking for Mr. Redstone, and is he capable of conveying his wishes through them?

The dispute centers on the abrupt and unexpected May 20 dismissals of Philippe P. Dauman, the chief executive of Viacom, and George S. Abrams, a Viacom director, from the trust that will control Mr. Redstone’s companies after he dies or is declared incompetent. Mr. Dauman and Mr. Abrams were also dismissed from the board of National Amusements, the private theater chain through which Mr. Redstone controls Viacom and CBS.

The moves were widely viewed as the first in a path that would lead to the firing of Mr. Dauman, who joined Mr. Abrams in filing a suit seeking to immediately block the actions.

Lawyers for Mr. Redstone assert that he is competent, and they are planning to move to dismiss the Massachusetts suit. They also argue that the question of Mr. Redstone’s competency is moot given that a majority of trustees already ratified his actions.

In new court filings on Monday, lawyers for Mr. Dauman and Mr. Abrams countered that the ratification was legally irrelevant because it is not permitted by the provisions of the trust. The trust allows only Mr. Redstone to remove trustees while he lives and has capacity, and does not allow for anyone else to remove trustees when he lacks capacity.

“There is reason for this carefully crafted removal power: Mr. Redstone wanted to make sure that neither his estranged daughter nor any family member would be able to remove independent trustees and thereby dominate the trust,” the court document states.

Even before the court determines whether Mr. Redstone had the mental capacity to oust the two executives, it must first assess what actions Mr. Redstone took to hire his legal team and instruct them to act on his behalf, said John C. Coffee Jr., director of the Center on Corporate Governance at Columbia Law School.

“It can’t be assumed that because someone shows up in court with a document that states, ‘I hereby remove X and Y from the trust,’ that they were authorized by Sumner Redstone to say that,” Mr. Coffee said.

“Did he have capacity to take that action?” he added.

Representatives for Mr. Redstone argue that although he suffers physical ailments, he remains mentally astute. A geriatric psychiatrist hired by Mr. Redstone stated in a report released last week that he retained “legal mental capacity” to make the business decisions he did, and that they “reflect his own authentic wishes and preferences,” based on two exams in the last two weeks.

Still, there is no question that Mr. Redstone’s health has declined significantly. Mr. Redstone had a series of minor strokes in the last two years that left him with a severe speech impediment. A judge in a recent civil suit said that a videotaped testimony of the media mogul showed that it was “not in dispute that Redstone suffers from either mild or moderate dementia.”

Lawyers for Mr. Dauman and Mr. Abrams called the geriatric psychiatrist’s report a “one-sided, uncross-examined and distorted view of Mr. Redstone’s mental condition,” in the court filings on Monday.

The combination of public disclosures related to Mr. Redstone’s health with his silence during board meetings led Viacom directors to eliminate his pay as a director and chairman emeritus of the company last month.

Then on May 16, three Viacom directors received an email from Mr. Tu, the new lawyer, notifying them that his law firm, Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe, had been hired to represent Mr. Redstone and his interests in Viacom.

Mr. Tu, a partner in Orrick’s security litigation practice in Los Angeles, was unknown to Mr. Dauman, Mr. Abrams and Frederic V. Salerno, Viacom’s lead independent director, who had all worked with Mr. Redstone for decades.

A lawyer for Mr. Salerno called Mr. Tu to try to confirm that he was authorized to represent Mr. Redstone and receive confidential corporate information on Mr. Redstone’s behalf. Mr. Tu refused to answer a question about whether he had met Mr. Redstone, according to court filings by Mr. Dauman and Mr. Abrams.

Mr. Tu did not answer Mr. Salerno’s query because of attorney-client privilege, said Mike Lawrence, a spokesman for Mr. Redstone, adding that Mr. Tu had “of course’’ met with his client.

Mr. Lawrence also said it was false to imply that Ms. Redstone had played a role in choosing her father’s new lawyer.

Mr. Redstone met Mr. Tu through Robert N. Klieger, who is also connected to Ms. Redstone. Mr. Klieger joined Mr. Redstone’s legal team in March in the midst of the salacious lawsuit challenging his mental competency that was filed by Manuela Herzer, his former companion. Ms. Redstone was aligned with her father in that suit. Mr. Klieger, a partner of the law firm Hueston Hennigan, is also representing Ms. Redstone in a new $100 million suit against her filed by Ms. Herzer. .

Mr. Klieger said in a statement that he had represented Mr. Redstone’s companies for more than 15 years and that his previous firm had represented Mr. Redstone in legal matters. He added that he had “never met or spoken” with Ms. Redstone or her representatives until several weeks after he was hired by Mr. Redstone in the Herzer case.

“She had nothing whatsoever to do with my hiring,” Mr. Klieger said. “Who is Mr. Redstone’s old legal team?”

In recent weeks, Mr. Redstone also retained a new spokesman, Mr. Lawrence, who holds the title of chief reputation officer at Cone Communications, which is based in Boston. Mr. Lawrence has released a series of statements in Mr. Redstone’s name but has never met him.

Mr. Lawrence was brought on by Mr. Redstone’s lawyers to help with media inquiries during the flurry of breaking news on May 21, the day after it was revealed that Mr. Dauman and Mr. Abrams had been ousted.

Mr. Lawrence issues statements on behalf of Mr. Redstone based on communication with Mr. Redstone’s lawyers, who work directly with the media mogul.

One such statement was a direct quotation from Mr. Redstone, who had not released a statement to the news media since October.

“This is my trust and my decision,” it read, attributing the comments to Mr. Redstone. “I have picked those who are loyal to me and removed those who are not.”
