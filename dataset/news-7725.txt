Eric Buterbaugh, perhaps best known as the imaginative Los Angeles-based florist-of-choice for celebrities like Demi Moore and Gwyneth Paltrow (not to mention fashion labels from Louis Vuitton to Dior), is bringing his chic blooms to New York City with a one-week pop-up shop at Bergdorf Goodman. And he’ll be offering his line of eight luxury, flower-inspired fragrances, EB Florals, there too. “So many people have tried to get me to open a flower shop in New York over the years,” Buterbaugh says. “So to be launching with Bergdorf’s is a dream come true.” Open May 2 through Mother’s Day, the pop-up shop will stock hand-tied bouquets, and in typical Buterbaugh style, there will be a larger-than-life floral installation over the store’s Fifth Avenue entrance too. “This is the Eric Buterbaugh power invasion of New York,” he says. “It’s going to be flower city!” In the above slide show, he teaches T how to expertly arrange flowers — for Mother’s Day, or anytime.
