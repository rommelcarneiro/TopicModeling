It took a while, but the Knicks will officially introduce Jeff Hornacek as their new coach on Friday, the news conference coming about two weeks after it became known that he was coming aboard.

Hornacek and the team’s president, Phil Jackson, will be meeting with the news media while the focus of the basketball world is on the N.B.A. finals, a reminder of just how far the Knicks need to go to be able to compete with teams like the Golden State Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers.

Hornacek, 53, who according to published reports will be paid $15 million over three years, will take over a team that was 32-50 this season, an improvement over its 17-65 record in 2014-15.

Hornacek is replacing Kurt Rambis, who served as the Knicks’ interim coach after Derek Fisher, Jackson’s initial pick for the coaching job, was fired in February after a year and a half in the position.

Hornacek’s biggest asset will be Kristaps Porzingis, who had an impressive rookie season, even if he seemed to run out of gas as the season wound down. Hornacek will also have Carmelo Anthony in his lineup, unless Anthony and the Knicks conclude that it would make more sense for him to play elsewhere at the age of 32.
