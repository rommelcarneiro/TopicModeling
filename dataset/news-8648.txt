A brush fire that billowed giant plumes of black smoke into the sky halted train service between New Jersey and New York on Tuesday afternoon.

Both New Jersey Transit and Amtrak reported that train travel between Newark and New York’s Pennsylvania Station had been temporarily suspended.

Amtrak said at 3 p.m. that Northeast Corridor service had been restored, but that passengers could expect delays. New Jersey Transit also said train service had resumed with delays of up to 60 minutes.

The police in Secaucus said the fire began near railroad tracks in the vicinity of Penhorn Avenue and Secaucus Road.

An additional brush fire in Kearny, N.J., started in the area of 1800 Harrison Avenue shortly after noon, the Kearny Fire Department said. It was deemed under control at 2:08 p.m.

PATH trains are honoring New Jersey Transit tickets and passes at the Newark Penn, Hoboken and New York 33rd Street stations, New Jersey Transit said on Twitter. Midtown Direct trains were being diverted to Hoboken.

At Secaucus Junction, Nadine Ruiz saw black smoke rising above the tracks on Tuesday afternoon as she was heading to class at Montclair State University.

“To see that much smoke was a little alarming,” said Ms. Ruiz, who lives in Jersey City.

Trains had stopped running. Ms. Ruiz messaged her professor to say she would miss class.

“The smoke got bigger and you could see flames from the station,” she said.

Photos began emerging on social media around 12:30 p.m., with the dark smoke visible from Brooklyn.
