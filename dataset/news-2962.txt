Performances at the outdoor music festival Governors Ball, including one by Kanye West, were canceled on Sunday because of severe weather.

In an email to ticket holders, the festival’s organizers said that “the safety of fans, artists and crew always comes first,” and that all performances for Sunday would be canceled because of “a high likelihood of lightning” around the stages at Randalls Island Park in New York.

Mr. West was the headliner among nearly two dozen performances scheduled for the festival’s third and final day. Fans expressed their disappointment on Twitter:

Governors Ball typically has a “rain or shine” policy. The festival has persisted in the past despite rain — most recently, Saturday. The Panorama festival, with a lineup including Arcade Fire, Kendrick Lamar and LCD Soundsystem, is scheduled to take place at the same location in July.

Ticket holders were told they would receive refunds, and were directed to the festival’s website for updates.
