LONDON — A former investment banker who had worked at Morgan Stanley, Lehman Brothers and Deutsche Bank was sentenced to four-and-a-half years in prison after he was convicted this week on an insider trading charge in what the British authorities have described as the largest crackdown on improper trading in Britain.

On Monday, Martyn Dodgson, a former banker, and Andrew Hind, a businessman and trained accountant, were convicted of conspiracy to “insider deal,” as insider trading is described in Britain.

Mr. Hind was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison on Thursday.

The case sprung out of an investigation called Operation Tabernula. The investigation began with a series of raids by the British authorities in March 2010.

The Financial Conduct Authority of Britain accused Mr. Dodgson of improperly sharing information from the investment banks where he worked with his close friend, Mr. Hind, as part of a conspiracy that began in November 2006 and ended in March 2010.

Mr. Hind acted as a middle man and helped facilitate trades for the benefit of Mr. Dodgson and himself, the Financial Conduct Authority said.

The tips included inside information about the Paragon Group, Legal & General and BSkyB, the regulator said.

Three other men on trial with Mr. Hind and Mr. Dodgson were acquitted of criminal charges this week.

The members of the conspiracy used unregistered mobile telephones, encrypted records and safe deposit boxes to hide their improper trading from authorities, the Financial Conduct Authority said.

Five people in all have pleaded guilty or been convicted of criminal charges in the investigation.
