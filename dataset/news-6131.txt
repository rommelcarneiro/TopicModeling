The first time the artist Faig Ahmed worked with textiles was when he was a student at the Azerbaijan State Academy of Fine Art in Baku: He stole rolls of printed fabric from the fashion department and used them to cover the school’s unattractive, five-story Soviet-era facade.

He was promptly expelled, but now that same iconoclasm is creating a stir with his mind-bending carpets: traditional Azerbaijani designs that have been psychedelically reassembled. Ahmed spent years getting to know old-school weavers and trying to convince them to craft his designs. “Most of them said no,” he recalls. “Finally someone said, ‘I will do it as long as you don’t tell anyone.’ ” It is essential for Ahmed that everything from the dyes to the technique to the material is meticulously orthodox; the result, of course, is anything but. “I don’t want to change anything, but at the same time I want to change everything,” he says.
