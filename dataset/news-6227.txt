Charlie’s Chocolate Factory has found its Wonka.

The actor Christian Borle, who has won two Tony Awards, for “Peter and the Starcatcher” and “Something Rotten!” will play Willy Wonka in a Broadway production of “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” next year, the producers announced Monday.

That makes for a busy season for Mr. Borle. This fall, between his departure from “Something Rotten!” and his arrival at “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,” he is to play Marvin in a Lincoln Center Theater revival of “Falsettos.”

The musical version of “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” that is slated for Broadway is to be a substantially retooled version of a musical that has been playing in London since 2013. Both are adapted from the 1964 book by Roald Dahl; the Broadway version is expected to more explicitly echo the sounds of the 1971 musical film, “Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory.”

One new indication that the producers are serious about reworking the British production: they said that they had hired Basil Twist, the acclaimed puppeteer whose singular aesthetic last year won him a so-called genius grant from the MacArthur Foundation, to join the project.

The Broadway show, like the London production, will feature music by Marc Shaiman, lyrics by Mr. Shaiman and Scott Wittman, a book by David Greig, and design by Mark Thompson. But it will feature a new director, Jack O’Brien, and choreographer, Joshua Bergasse.

The musical is being produced by Warner Bros. Theatre Ventures, Langley Park Productions and Neal Street Productions, and is scheduled to begin performances next March at Broadway’s Lunt-Fontanne Theater.
