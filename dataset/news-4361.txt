The Republican Jewish Coalition, a group heavily financed by the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, on Tuesday condemned what it called a rising tide of anti-Semitic invective against journalists covering the presidential race.

The statement came amid a torrent of Twitter posts and comments against Jewish journalists, many of whom have written about Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee.

“We abhor any abuse of journalists, commentators and writers whether it be from Sanders, Clinton or Trump supporters,” the statement said.

“There is no room for any of this in any campaign. Journalists, regardless of their race, religion or ethnicity should be free to do their jobs without suffering abuses, anti-Semitic or otherwise,” the statement went on.

Among the writers who have faced such attacks is Julia Ioffe, a magazine writer who profiled Melania Trump, the wife of Mr. Trump. Mrs. Trump and her husband have declined to take responsibility for the words of their supporters or urge them to stop. Mr. Trump has, however, condemned some forms of anti-Semitism, most notably from the former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke.

On the Democratic side, some supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders have been critical of journalists over their coverage of his views on Israel.

Mr. Adelson, for whom Israel’s security is a premier issue, recently announced his support for Mr. Trump and told people he was willing to spend roughly $100 million in support of his fellow casino owner.
