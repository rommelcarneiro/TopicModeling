I’ve watched so much “Being Erica” in the last three days I think I’ve become Canadian. While I don’t cry at every single episode, I do cry at least a little during most of them — so I’ve been getting a bit misty every two hours for the past week. It’s been cathartic.

I’ve also been obsessively listening to “Merrily We Roll Along.” And not just because I love narratives that are unstuck in time — “Being Erica” sends its main character back to her past, and “Merrily” is told backward. I’ve also been craving stories — TV shows, musicals, novels, Instagram accounts — that are about big emotions. Save your action sequences and your blood baths. Give me wrenching monologues, moments of profound personal triumph, a way to reflect on my own experiences, a character I care about so completely it should be embarrassing. That, or be a glamorous Japanese dog who wears flower crowns and barrettes.

This weekend I’ll be watching more “Being Erica,” trying to parse the finale of the off-the-rails-in-a-bad-way “Quantico” and hoping “Game of Thrones” picks up the pace. Less farting, more feelings. My hope for the world, I guess. See you Monday.

Watch the season finale of “The Last Man on Earth.”

This Will Forte-led comedy, about a tiny group of people who survived a global plague, sometimes plays up its silliness, and sometimes plays up its nastiness. Every once in a while, though, it cuts through its impressively strange loopiness to admit that its characters have endured unbelievable tragedy having watched everyone they knew die. Last season’s finale introduced the twist of Phil’s (Forte) astronaut brother (Jason Sudeikis) being alive in space. Without spoiling anything, I’ll say this season’s finale lives up to its predecessor. (Sunday, 9:30 p.m., Fox; catch up on the whole series on Hulu)

Watch Ali Wong’s stand-up special “Baby Cobra.”

Filmed when Wong was seven and a half months pregnant, it covers, yes, pregnancy, but also sex, gender roles, race, domesticity and the trappings of modern partnership. “I don’t want to ‘lean in,’” Wong says. “I want to lay down.” The material gets extraordinarily blue and scatological, but Wong’s control and quick rhythm keep things from feeling crass. (Watch on Netflix)

Watch “Believeland.”

The latest “30 for 30” documentary is about professional sports in Cleveland and the championship drought the city has experienced for 50-plus years. It will leave you with a sense of despair and sadness, not just about sports but also about the economic and psychological health of the Rust Belt. Thanks, ESPN! (Saturday, 9:30 p.m., ESPN).

Watch “Being Erica.”

Our heroine Erica Strange (Erin Karpluk, just fantastic) is an unhappy wreck: She’s underemployed, vaguely depressed, single and has a strained relationship with her family. Also, she has a lot of regrets. After a terrible day, she winds up in the care of Dr. Tom, a therapist who tells her to write down these regrets — and then with magical realism that the show does not labor to explain, Erica gets to go back to each of these moments to try to do what she wishes she’d done. Each regret always somehow resonates with her current situation, but the show manages to be wistful and gentle, not corny or contrived. The pilot looks like it was filmed on a Tamagotchi, but production values pick up.

Most coming-of-age stories are set between childhood and adulthood. “Being Erica” is set within adulthood — between “adulthood” and adulthood. Erica isn’t immature in that she’s irresponsible but rather in that she doesn’t feel she’s hatched yet, like she’s become anyone. The problems on this show are grown-up problems like grief and divorce, not sitcom shenanigans, and Erica’s attempts to fix her past mistakes more often lead to illumination rather than pat resolution.

If you like shows like “Veronica Mars,” “Dead Like Me,” “Wonderfalls,” or more recent series like “Younger,” or “Parenthood,” try “Being Erica.” Bonus points: Drake has a small role in the second episode, a dozen other “Degrassi” alums appear throughout the series and Tatiana Maslany of “Orphan Black” has a recurring role starting in Season 2. Shoutout to Slate’s June Thomas for alerting me that this long-lost treasure was finally streaming. (Watch on Hulu)

‘The Lobster’

Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz star in Yorgos Lanthimos’s surreal romantic drama, which is set in a world where people have 45 days to find a partner or they will be turned into an animal. Kooky, right? As A.O. Scott writes: “Cruelty and humor are nestled like spoons in a drawer. Mr. Lanthimos’s method is to elicit an appreciative chuckle followed by a gasp of shock, and to deliver violence and whimsy in the same even tone.” (This film is in limited release.)

‘A Bigger Splash’

Tilda Swinton stars as a David Bowie-esque rock star who is recovering on a sunny Italian island after having throat surgery that prevents her from speaking much. Ralph Fiennes and Dakota Johnson also star in this Luca Guadagnino film, where everyone is attractive and the vistas are beautiful. As Manohla Dargis writes, “The world that Mr. Guadagnino creates is at once seductive and aspirational, and another reminder that movies have always excelled at stoking consumer desires.” (This film is in limited release.)
