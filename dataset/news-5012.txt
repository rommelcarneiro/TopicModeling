Donald J. Trump escalated his attacks on former President Bill Clinton’s past in an interview on Wednesday with Sean Hannity on Fox News, bringing up an old allegation of rape.

Discussing a recent New York Times article regarding Mr. Trump’s history with women, Mr. Hannity led Mr. Trump down a line of questioning, naming women who had accused Mr. Clinton of sexual misconduct.

“For example, I looked at The New York Times,” Mr. Hannity said. “Are they going to interview Juanita Broaddrick? Are they going to interview Paula Jones? Are they going to interview Kathleen Willey?”

He continued: “In one case, it’s about exposure. In another case, it’s about groping and fondling and touching against a woman’s will.”

Mr. Trump interjected, unprompted: “And rape.”

He was referring to Ms. Broaddrick, who made her allegations public in 1999. They were publicly denied by Mr. Clinton’s personal lawyer, David E. Kendall, who called them “absolutely false.”

Mr. Trump has repeatedly mentioned past allegations against Mr. Clinton. On Tuesday, he wrote on Twitter that Mr. Clinton was “the WORST abuser of woman in U.S. political history.”

And on the campaign trail, Mr. Trump has tried to tie Hillary Clinton to the scandals, such as by referring to her as an “enabler” in a speech in Eugene, Ore., this month.

Nick Merrill, the traveling press secretary for the Clinton campaign, likened Mr. Trump’s latest allegations to “doing what he does best, attacking when he feels wounded and dragging the American people through the mud for his own gain.”

Mr. Merrill added: “If that’s the kind of campaign he wants to run, that’s his choice. Hillary Clinton is running a campaign to be president for all of America. It’s not surprising that after a week of still refusing to release his taxes and likening Oakland and Ferguson to the dangers in Iraq, of course he wants to change the subject. So while he licks his wounds, we’ll continue to focus on improving the lives of the American people.”
