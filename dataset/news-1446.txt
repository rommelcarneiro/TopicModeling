Looking for a summer dance festival? Try going outside: More and more New York City parks are becoming outdoor festival sites, and every Friday through July 8, Bryant Park Presents Modern Dance hosts companies representing many contemporary styles.

On Friday, June 24, Nicole Philippidis’s emotionally driven “Inside Out/Outside In,” for her 277 Dance Project, includes a film of an industrial space in the Mott Haven section of the Bronx, and its dancers could be factory workers. Earl Mosley’s Diversity of Dance presents three spirited pieces: Mr. Mosley’s “Wild and Free!!! (Draft 7)”; Clifton Brown’s “L’Estro Armonico,” to Vivaldi; and, in contrast, Matthew Rushing’s “Red White & Blues” set to “The Star-Spangled Banner.” The Amy Marshall Dance Company juxtaposes the calm of “My Love” and “Solstice,” set to flowing music by Bach, with the turbulence of “Askew,” which divides dancers into two groups with constantly shifting allegiances. (6 p.m., free; bryantpark.org.)
