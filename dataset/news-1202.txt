The tracksuit, with its matching zip jacket and jogger pants, is a sartorial symbol of leisure — and, sometimes, laziness. It’s a look straight out of ’80s hip-hop videos, “The Royal Tenenbaums” or “Goodfellas.” But on the runways at London Collections Men and Pitti Uomo, the look took on a distinctly luxury feel. Christopher Shannon offered a version entirely of denim, and color-blocked with different washes, while Topman Design showed one with a pair of loafers. And the designer Gosha Rubchinskiy, the invited guest designer at this season’s Pitti, looked to his ’90s Eastern Bloc roots and dressed his models in a number of tracksuits, including some that were collaborations with the original Italian purveyors of the style: Fila, Kappa and Sergio Tacchini.
