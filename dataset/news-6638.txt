“Jefferson” (1970) Long before the Broadway musical “Hamilton,” Mr. Rzewski gave early America a stirring spin. Sung in a plain, forceful style, like a medieval chant, the opening lines of the Declaration of Independence are joined to a burbling, surging piano part.

“Coming Together” (1972) Using incantatory fragments from a 1971 letter by Sam Melville, who was among the 43 men who died that year in the uprising by inmates at the Attica prison in upstate New York, the music builds in frustration and fury. “I am in excellent physical and emotional health,” the letter says, with agonizing irony. “There are doubtless subtle surprises ahead, but I feel secure and ready.”

Variations on “The People United Will Never Be Defeated” (1975) In 36 dazzling takes on a Chilean protest song, Mr. Rzewski endows leftist politics with irresistible glamour and force. A recent recording by Igor Levit juxtaposes the work with two epochal sets of variations — Bach’s “Goldbergs” and Beethoven’s “Diabellis” — and “The People United” didn’t suffer by comparison.

“Winnsboro Cotton Mill Blues” (1980) Opening with a steady chugging, this work has parts that can seem, on the surface, merely charming. But in the end its pointed metaphor for labor’s relation to capital is clear, with a churning, nightmarish evocation of mill machines eventually overwhelming a gentle ragtime workers’ song.

“De Profundis” (1992) A setting of Oscar Wilde’s letter from prison, where he had been sent for “gross indecency,” Mr. Rzewski’s work demands much of its pianist-vocalist, who clucks, whistles dolefully, hits his or her own chest (the pianist is supposed to wear a lapel mike) and, the score indicates at one point, “sings, half-sobbing.” It’s a solo cantata, one that heightens our perception of Wilde’s suffering and pushes us to reflect on his conviction.
