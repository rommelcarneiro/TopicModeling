United States stocks rose on Tuesday as investors were relieved to hear Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, say the central bank would remain cautious about raising interest rates.

Stocks hardly budged for most of the day as investors were occupied with Ms. Yellen’s appearance on Capitol Hill and the vote this week on Britain’s possible withdrawal from the European Union.

For the second day in a row, stocks traded higher and bond prices fell as investors felt a bit surer that Britain would stay in the E.U.

Ms. Yellen told the Senate that the Fed would proceed cautiously in raising interest rates because of uncertainties facing the American economy, including a recent slowdown in job growth. Ms. Yellen’s testimony will conclude on Wednesday.

“The market seems to have responded well to Dr. Yellen’s tone of caution,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist for Federated Investors.

The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 5.65 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,088.90. The Nasdaq composite added 6.55 points, or 0.1 percent, to 4,843.76.

The Dow Jones industrial average picked up 24.86 points, or 0.1 percent, to 17,829.73.

Energy companies climbed despite a dip in the price of oil, which is still trading above its lows from early this year. Crude has risen about 7 percent over the last two days. Benchmark United States crude fell 52 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $48.85 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil prices, slipped 3 cents, to $50.62 a barrel in London.

Schlumberger gained 93 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $78.52 and Occidental Petroleum picked up $1.06, or 1.4 percent, to $77.16.

Opinion polls and betting markets indicate that Britons are more likely to vote to remain in the E.U. in a referendum on Thursday. Uncertainty about the outcome has weighed on global markets.
