WASHINGTON — The Washington Redskins signed cornerback Josh Norman on Friday, two days after the Carolina Panthers cut him loose.

Norman, one of the N.F.L.’s top cornerbacks, became a free agent Wednesday after the Panthers rescinded the franchise tag, which would have paid him $13.9 million this season. Norman, 28, was holding out for a long-term contract.

Norman had a career-high four interceptions, 16 passes defensed and 56 tackles last season for the N.F.C. champion Panthers. He also scuffled with Odell Beckham Jr., which led to a one-game suspension for the Giants receiver.

He posted the hashtag “Hail” with several emoji on his Twitter account to announce that he had picked the Redskins over other suitors, and several new teammates congratulated him and welcomed him to Washington.

“Let me be the first to say Welcome to the Family,” defensive back DeAngelo Hall said in a tweet.

Earlier in the afternoon and Thursday, Washington players used Twitter to try to convince Norman to sign. It only took one visit to make that happen.

Norman visited the Redskins’ complex in Ashburn, Va., on Friday. After signing, he posed for pictures with family members and Scot McCloughan, the Redskins’ general manager.

Norman’s signing fills a major need because Redskins cornerback Chris Culliver is still recovering from a knee injury.

Joining the Redskins was a much happier occasion for Norman than being shown the door by the Panthers, who wished him well in a terse statement earlier in the week.

“After a number of conversations with Josh’s agent we realized that a long-term deal was not attainable,” Dave Gettleman, the Panthers’ general manager, said in a release. “We have decided to rescind the franchise tag freeing Josh to immediately become” an unrestricted free agent.
