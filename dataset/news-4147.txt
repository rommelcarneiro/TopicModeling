Wednesday began with quickly disputed reports that the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, was about to endorse Donald J. Trump, the Republican Party’s presumptive nominee.

It ended with Mr. Trump firing his national political director, Rick Wiley, who had been hired to great fanfare just six weeks earlier.

In between, Mr. Trump insulted his former primary rivals at a rally in California.

Whatever pretense was made, soon after Mr. Trump lost the Wisconsin primary, of his being on the verge of behaving like a more traditional candidate is now gone. Mr. Trump is back in peak midprimary form.

That would be fine if he weren’t already the presumptive nominee. But the general election will feature at least 100 million voters who have not taken part in either party’s primary, a majority of whom Mr. Trump will need. And drama around his campaign has engulfed him on a nearly ceaseless basis.

To be sure, it was not all bad news for Mr. Trump on Wednesday, although the good news was not at his hand. In a new report, the inspector general of the State Department criticized Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, for her email practices while secretary of state, saying that she did not seek permission for her private server.

But the email scandal details are fairly well known to voters at this point. Mr. Trump is still making his opening pitch for November, and he is having trouble staying on course.
