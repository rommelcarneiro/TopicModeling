Conor McGregor, one of the Ultimate Fighting Championship’s top draws, created a stir on social media on Tuesday when he wrote on Twitter that retirement was on the horizon.

“I have decided to retire young,” McGregor, 27, wrote. “Thanks for the cheese. Catch ya’s later.”

Some observers were skeptical that McGregor was leaving the sport, in part because he had been scheduled for a rematch against Nate Diaz at the main event of U.F.C. 200 on July 9. Diaz himself made light of McGregor’s announcement, playfully writing on Twitter, “I guess my work here is done I’m retiring too.”

Later on Tuesday, the U.F.C. wrote on Twitter that McGregor had been pulled from U.F.C. 200.

The U.F.C.’s president, Dana White, told ESPN that he had removed McGregor from the card because McGregor had decided not to attend prefight promotional appearances in Las Vegas — not because he had announced his retirement.

“Is Conor McGregor retiring? Only he can answer that question,” White told ESPN. “I don’t know. But he will not be a part of U.F.C. 200.”

McGregor’s coach, John Kavanagh, seemed to lend credence to McGregor’s farewell by writing on Twitter, “Well was fun while it lasted.”

McGregor, a brash fighter from Ireland, claimed the undisputed featherweight title in December, knocking out Jose Aldo in 13 seconds. The bout was the fastest title fight in U.F.C. history and improved McGregor’s U.F.C. record to 7-0, with five straight knockouts.

Last month, however, McGregor lost a welterweight bout against Diaz, a short-notice replacement.

McGregor was a spectator this month at a fight in Dublin, two days after which the loser, Joao Carvalho, died. On Tuesday, fans speculated that might have prompted McGregor’s retirement post.
