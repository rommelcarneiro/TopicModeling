The Roman jeweler’s brooches, rings and earrings are inspired by the 17th-century Baroque aesthetic of Borromini and Bernini, and designed, he says, to coax their wearers into upright postures and engender “regal attitudes.” Lavish gemstone mosaics — lemon quartz, green tourmalines, rose rubies — are combined with delicate miniatures painted on copper.

The jewelry of the former costume designer evokes ancient Rome, with homage paid to the Greeks and Etruscans, too. His gilded cuffs and necklaces strung with empire-era coins and intricate cameos are marvels of metalwork. Molded from 21-karat gold, they might be mistaken for purloined antiquities.

Salini’s modern take on flora makes clever use of elements old and new. For a pair of fanciful earrings, lightweight, high-tech carbon fiber is fashioned into delicate branches sprouting milky opal buds and diamond-studded petals; for a statement ring, the same material is double coiled and crowned with an oversize pearl.
