SAN JOSE, Calif. — Martin Jones made 22 saves in his second straight shutout and Tomas Hertl scored twice Thursday to give the San Jose Sharks a series lead for the first time in four trips to the Western Conference finals with a 3-0 victory over the St. Louis Blues.

Joonas Donskoi also scored to give the Sharks a two-games-to-one series advantage and move them as close as they have ever been to their first Stanley Cup finals. San Jose had won just three combined games in its first three trips to the conference finals, part of a long history of playoff disappointment.

St. Louis has gone 150 minutes 45 seconds without scoring since Jori Lehtera’s second-period goal in its 2-1 victory in Game 1.

After allowing that soft goal to Lehtera, Jones has been perfect the past two games. He has stopped 58 straight shots and has posted the first back-to-back playoff shutouts in Sharks history.

Game 4 is Saturday in San Jose, where the Sharks have won six straight playoff games.
