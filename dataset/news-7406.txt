Declan Walsh, our bureau chief in Cairo, is in a government-controlled area of Aleppo, Syria, covering the civil war. As bombs fall on the city, he is talking to civilians, witnessing the wounded and interviewing soldiers who have been at war for years. On Saturday, we will publish his in-depth look at the besieged city, but here is a first look from his point of view. Follow him on Instagram.

The reaction to the sound of shellfire varies dramatically in Aleppo, depending on which neighborhood, or even street, you happen to be standing in. In some places, people don’t even flinch, and continue as if nothing has happened; in others like Midan, where civilians have died from mortar fire in recent days, they quicken their step and move to safety.

This road — a narrow strip of undulating asphalt lined by the ruins of bombed villages — is the lifeline of Aleppo, Syria’s most populous city. Opposition forces lie to the left, Islamic State to the right. Trucks speed along the road, pressing toward Aleppo. Nobody stops if they can help it.

A heavy barrage of shells fired from rebel-held areas fell on Aleppo on Thursday morning. The emergency room at Al Razi Hospital was inundated with the wounded. This man arrived unconscious with a gash in his head and was quickly wheeled off to an operating room.

Passing though Homs, en route to Aleppo, we caught a glimpse of the destroyed ancient city. Residents go about their business, but look weary.
