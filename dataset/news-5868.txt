The Curtis Institute of Music, the prestigious conservatory in Philadelphia, announced on Thursday that it has been given a $55 million gift from the outgoing chairwoman of its board, Nina Baroness von Maltzahn. It is one of the largest gifts ever made to an American music school, and a statement from the conservatory described the gift as the largest single donation it had received since Mary Louise Curtis Bok established its tuition-free policy in 1928.

The statement said that the gift would be added to its endowment to help support a number of strategic initiatives — one of which is to remain tuition-free — as the conservatory prepares to celebrate its centennial in 2024.

The baroness, who joined the Curtis board of overseers in 2008, became a trustee in 2010 and began a two-year term as chairwoman in 2014, said in a statement that the school’s students had grown close to her heart. “To hear them perform, to support their learning and to see them flourish is immensely gratifying,” she said.

Mark Rubenstein, who will succeed her as chairman of the board, thanked her for her generosity. “Curtis’s signature full-tuition scholarship policy has kept the school at the forefront of the world’s conservatories,” he said in a statement. “However, with no tuition revenue, it also means that the generosity of individual donors is of extreme importance.”

Curtis will rename its string quartet program and its touring initiative in her honor.
