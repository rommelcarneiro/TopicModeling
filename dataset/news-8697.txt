A little piece of New York is thriving in New Orleans. Mani Dawes, below right, an owner of Tía Pol in Chelsea, and her husband, Sean Josephs, below left, who owns Maysville in the Flatiron district, have relocated their family to the Big Easy. Easier indeed: Ms. Dawes’s mother is there to help with babysitting. In a neighborhood west of the Garden District (I thought it was somewhat remote, but locals say not) they have opened a handsome sibling for Maysville, also with a bourbon focus and named for the founder of Maysville, Ky., a port town on the Ohio River. Burnished wood, marble and cast-iron arches that could evoke New York as much as New Orleans set the stage for a menu of oysters (raw, grilled, fried and served on vintage oyster plates), red snapper tartare, smoked trout and grilled pork: Kenton’s, 5757 Magazine Street, New Orleans, 504-891-1177, kentonsrestaurant.com.
