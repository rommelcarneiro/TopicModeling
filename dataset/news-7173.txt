“The Jungle Book” sold more tickets in its third weekend in North American theaters than three new wide-release films — “Keanu,” “Mother’s Day” and “Ratchet & Clank” — managed to sell combined in their first.

Now ranking No. 1 for three weeks running, “The Jungle Book” (Disney) collected an estimated $42.4 million, for a new domestic total of $252 million, according to comScore, which compiles box office data. Disney also had a blockbuster weekend overseas, where “The Jungle Book” took in $57.1 million, for a foreign total of $432.7 million, and “Captain America: Civil War,” which starts screening in the United States Thursday night, began to roll out, collecting $200.2 million.

“Keanu,” a well-reviewed comedy starring Jordan Peele and Keegan-Michael Key, a pair who have been a hit on TV but have never before appeared in a movie together, failed to break out. It took in about $9.4 million, below what Warner Bros. and its New Line unit had hoped for before release. Some analysts had anticipated up to $15 million in initial ticket sales. “Keanu” cost about $15 million to make.

“Mother’s Day” (Open Road), with a cast that included Jennifer Aniston, Kate Hudson and a badly bewigged Julia Roberts, took in a humdrum $8.3 million; “Mother’s Day” cost at least $25 million to make. And the animated “Ratchet & Clank,” released by Focus Features on its Gramercy label, flopped with $4.8 million in ticket sales, becoming the latest example of a popular video game that failed to translate on the big screen.
