To the Editor:

We read with disappointment your article “When a Board Has More Women on It, the Boss May Make Even More Money” (Gretchen Morgenson, Fair Game, May 29).

While Ms. Morgenson does acknowledge that the analysis of the Equilar fact base “doesn’t necessarily prove cause and effect,” we found the interpretation to be unsupported conjecture with a surprisingly negative bias toward women on boards. Suggesting that women on public company boards are voting for C.E.O. pay packages to “fit in” with their board colleagues does not take into account findings by Catalyst, Credit Suisse and McKinsey & Company that when women are on boards, companies deliver better long-term results. This might explain the higher C.E.O. compensation.

A more insightful article might have dug deeper into why only eight of the 100 companies cited by Equilar are led by women, or why United States public companies remain slow to add female directors in meaningful numbers, or how few nominating and governance committees are led by women.

“The Overinflated Fear of Being Priced Out of Housing” (The Upshot, Economic View, June 12), Robert J. Shiller of Yale examined the steep price increases found in some cities.

The article drew 115 comments to nytimes.com. The following have been edited and condensed.

“At the same time, employment growth has been relatively tepid in cities like Boston, Cleveland and New York, and so have home price increases.” A condo in my Boston neighborhood sold for $250,000 in 2005. Today the price is $400,000. If that’s “relatively tepid” growth, I’d hate to see it heat up!

Housing price increases have been “tepid” in New York City?

Ever been to Brooklyn?
