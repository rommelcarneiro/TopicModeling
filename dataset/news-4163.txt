NATIONAL

A National Briefing item on May 12 about Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona signing a bill asserting the state’s ownership over a herd of horses along Salt River misstated the number of horses involved. It is 100 horses, not 500.

NEW YORK

An article in some editions on May 18 about claims that Covenant House, a youth shelter, had inflated the number of people it serves misstated the status of funding it receives from New York City, using information from city officials. The city has continued to make payments on its contract with the organization; funding has not been suspended.

•

A picture caption on Tuesday with an article about a Chinese-language ambulance service in Brooklyn misspelled, in some editions, the surname of a medical technician whose reflection could be seen in a rearview mirror. He is Jason Lau, not Lou.

BUSINESS DAY

An article in the DealBook special section on April 7, about financial technology start-ups, rendered incorrectly the original name of the online bank Simple. It was BankSimple, not SimpleBank. The error was only recently called to The Times’s attention.

THE ARTS

A theater review on Tuesday about “Hadestown,” at New York Theater Workshop in Manhattan, misspelled the given name of the actress who plays Eurydice. As the listing of credits correctly noted, she is Nabiyah Be, not Nabiya. (The error was repeated in a picture caption.)
