For weeks, Hillary Clinton and her campaign have struggled to find a line of attack that could work against Donald J. Trump, one of the most atypical and nonideological candidates the Republicans have prepared to nominate for president.

On Tuesday, she appeared to have found one. Mrs. Clinton seized on a comment that Mr. Trump made when he was running Trump University in 2006, in which he appeared to root for a housing bubble collapse because, he said, people like him could make money off it.

In a style similar to Twitter attacks against Mr. Trump by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Mrs. Clinton’s team repeatedly posted that her main rival was ultimately looking out only for himself.

“In Trump’s world, a ‘good result’ means Trump gets his and working families get hurt. We’re better than that,” Mrs. Clinton’s aides wrote in one post on Twitter.

It is an effort to try and define Mr. Trump along the same line Democrats used with Mitt Romney in 2012 — as a heartless businessman. Whether it can succeed remains to be seen.

In a statement, Mr. Trump said: “I am a businessman, and I have made a lot of money in down markets. In some cases, as much as I’ve made when markets are good. Frankly, this is the kind of thinking our country needs, understanding how to get a good result out of a very bad and sad situation. Politicians have no idea how to do this — they don’t have a clue.”

But Mrs. Clinton’s team has hoped to portray Mr. Trump as a dangerous “con man,” as Democrats have said for days, whose self-interest clashes with the reservoir of populism he has tapped into.

And in critical battlegrounds like Florida and Nevada, where the 2008 housing crisis was deeply felt, Mr. Trump’s past comments could haunt him. The question for Mrs. Clinton is whether she can penetrate the din that Mr. Trump has created around scandals from her husband’s days in the White House.
