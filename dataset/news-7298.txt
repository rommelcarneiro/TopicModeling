Fans who gorge on TV coverage of the National Football League draft can turn to the Smithsonian Channel for a digestif on Sunday, May 1: a football-themed episode of a new series called “Sports Detectives.” Each installment tries to track down or determine the authenticity of sports memorabilia, and here the objects in question are the 1964 championship ring that belonged to the Cleveland Browns running back Jim Brown and the football that ricocheted into the arms of the Pittsburgh Steelers’ Franco Harris in the 1972 play known as the Immaculate Reception. The findings by the “detectives” — Lauren Gardner, a sports reporter, and Kevin Barrows, a private investigator — aren’t always definitive, but the fun is in the revisiting of these moments. (The series premiere on April 24 concerned the flag that draped the goalie Jim Craig after the United States hockey team’s gold medal victory at the Lake Placid Olympics in 1980.) And, especially in the segment on the ring, a story that involves a divorce and a possible burglary, the quests provide a window into the sometimes murky sports-memorabilia world.
