The venture capital industry, which has been instrumental in nurturing Silicon Valley technology start-ups, lost one of its pioneers this week.

Thomas J. Perkins, who co-founded the venture firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, died Tuesday at the age of 84. He helped put venture capital on the map in Silicon Valley, including by going beyond passive investing to taking a more hands-on role in helping start-ups grow.

“I thought that ventures could be managed like development projects within a corporation,” Mr. Perkins wrote in his autobiography “Valley Boy: The Education of Tom Perkins” about a founding principle behind Kleiner Perkins.

In Silicon Valley itself, reaction to Mr. Perkins’s death was relatively muted, though some tech executives posted on Twitter about the effect he had on their careers.

Mr. Perkins belonged to an earlier era of start-up investing, when the companies he nurtured were still laying the foundations for the modern computing age, writes Michael de la Merced. Mr. Perkins’s arc came to symbolize Silicon Valley’s maturation: Later in his life, he became a more corporate figure, sitting on the boards of multiple public companies, and moving in elite societal circles.
