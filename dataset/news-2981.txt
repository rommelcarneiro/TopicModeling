Kathryn Tracy Farley and Richard Jay Lipton were married June 4 at the Catholic Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Atlanta. Msgr. Henry Grancz performed the ceremony.

The bride, 52, is keeping her name. She is an adjunct assistant professor of performance studies at Kennesaw State University in Kennesaw, Ga., and an adjunct lecturer in digital arts at Georgia Tech in Atlanta. She graduated from Georgetown and received a master’s degree in theater and a doctorate in performance studies from Northwestern.

The groom, 69, is a professor of computer science at Georgia Tech. He is the founder and an author of Gödel’s Lost Letter, a math and science blog. He graduated from Case Western Reserve and received a doctorate in computer science from Carnegie Mellon. The groom’s previous marriage ended in divorce.

The couple met when the bride was interested in collaborating with the groom on an experimental theater project that would incorporate content from his blog. Distracted by their instant connection, they abandoned the play idea and instead planned a first date.
