The top intelligence official in the United States said on Monday that a review to declassify 28 pages of material in a Sept. 11 report, which families of victims and some lawmakers are demanding be made public, could be completed by June.

The official, James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, suggested the timing of the release of the pages to reporters at a breakfast meeting in Washington.

Amid speculation about a possible Saudi role, several members of the House and Senate have joined the victimsâ€™ families in pressing for declassification of the pages, which are part of government documents compiled on the Sept. 11 attacks.

Some officials say the material could reveal that Saudi Arabia backed the men who hijacked airplanes, flying two into the World Trade Center in New York and another into the Pentagon.
