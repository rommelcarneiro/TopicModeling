Founded in 1707 by Hugh Mason, a grocer, and William Fortnum, a royal footman, the English purveyor Fortnum & Mason is famous for its teas, preserves and cookies. For the first time since 1929, some of its products are being sold in America in an exclusive arrangement with Williams-Sonoma. Among the teas are classics like English Breakfast and newer ones like a delicate green Earl Grey. Jams include raspberry, strawberry and grapefruit, and the standouts in the category of biscuits, which we call cookies, are chocolate-macadamia nut, chocolate-dipped, and pistachio with clotted cream. The companyâ€™s lavish gift assortments in wicker hampers are also available, and in late fall, there will be Christmas puddings: Fortnum & Mason, Williams-Sonoma stores, williams-sonoma.com.
