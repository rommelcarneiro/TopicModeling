HARRISON, N.J. — Bradley Wright-Phillips scored two of his team’s three goals in a 10-minute span as the Red Bulls rallied to beat Orlando City, 3-2, on Sunday night, ending a four-game losing streak.

Wright-Phillips, who was fifth in M.L.S. with 17 goals last season, scored his first goal of the season in the 69th minute to put the Red Bulls up, 2-1. He poked in a left-footer about six minutes later, off a perfect cross by Lloyd Sam, to double the advantage.

Cyle Larin tapped in a feed from Rafael Ramos to give Orlando City (2-2-3) a 1-0 lead in the third minute.

After Sacha Kljestan threaded a pass through the legs of Orlando defender Tommy Redding, Mike Grella tied it in the 65th.

The Red Bulls’ Karl Ouimette headed in an own goal off a corner in the 84th minute to cap the scoring.

The Red Bulls (2-6-0) came into the game with 3 points, the fewest in M.L.S.
