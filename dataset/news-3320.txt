A Dutch citizen and two companies he owned ran a multimillion-dollar mail-fraud scheme that targeted hundreds of thousands of older Americans, according to a civil complaint announced on Thursday by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn.

The complaint, filed on Wednesday in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, accuses the man, Erik Dekker, and his companies, which are based in the Netherlands, of using the scheme, known in the direct-mail industry as a “caging service,” to steal up to $18 million annually from its victims since at least 2012.

Mr. Dekker, 54, a resident of Langbroek, a town in the Utrecht province of the Netherlands, sent fraudulent solicitations to thousands of older adults in Brooklyn and elsewhere, saying they could claim various prizes if they mailed cash fees of $15 to $55 to his two companies, Trends Service in Kommunikatie and Kommunikatie Service Buitenland, prosecutors said.

In one instance, according to the complaint, victims were told that they were the beneficiaries of a nonexistent investment firm called the Midas Financial Group and stood to receive up to $15 million from the liquidation of its trust, if they mailed an “administrative fee” of $14.87 to one of the Dutch companies. In another, victims were told that they had won a 2015 Audi A6 sedan and could claim it if they sent in a $20 “owner/acquisition fee.”

Prosecutors said the solicitations were deceptively written to appear as if they had been personally sent to each person who received them, when they were actually form letters mailed to hundreds of thousands of people. The civil complaint was accompanied by a request for an injunction that would prohibit Mr. Dekker and his companies from using the Postal Service.

Mr. Dekker remains in the Netherlands. A spokeswoman for the United States attorney’s office in Brooklyn declined to comment on Thursday on whether prosecutors would seek his extradition.
