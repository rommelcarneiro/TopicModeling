Next week is full of tech conference extravaganzas.

There’s Apple, which is set to hold its annual developer conference in San Francisco. The video game industry, meanwhile, will be congregating in all its glory in Los Angeles for its buzziest trade show, the Electronic Entertainment Expo, popularly known as E3.

Both events will occur against a backdrop of flux.

Apple’s developer conference has for years sucked the air out of the room in the tech industry, with people looking to the company’s pronouncements for the next big thing in mobile and beyond. But Apple’s flagship product, the iPhone, is now slowing down, putting pressure on the company to pull something new out of a hat.

E3 is grappling with its own shifts, writes Laura Parker. The show was designed to gather retailers, video game publishers and media under one roof to give a peek at the big titles coming out for PC and console games. But now people have many more forms of gaming to be entertained by — free mobile games that can be digitally downloaded and constantly refreshed, for instance.

Which has raised questions on the relevance of E3: This year, several of the industry’s biggest publishers are not participating. Instead, E3’s organizers are emphasizing new game technologies, like virtual reality.
