Welcome to Times Insider Events — live programming for Times Insiders and their guests. Times Insider offers behind-the-scenes insights into news, features and opinion at The New York Times.

Join us on June 6 for an inside look at Modern Love, one of The Times’s most popular columns — and now also a podcast.

The discussion will include Daniel Jones, the editor of The Times’s Modern Love column; Dan Barry, a columnist at The Times; and Jessica Alpert, the podcast’s producer at WBUR.

Times Insiders will be notified of the event location and the ticketing details via email.
