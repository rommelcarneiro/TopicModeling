LONDON — Philips, the Dutch electronics giant, said on Thursday that the initial public offering of its lighting unit valued the business at 3 billion euros, or about $3.3 billion, based on market capitalization.

Shares of Philips Lighting were priced at €20 a share, the midpoint of its expected range of €18.50 to €22.50 a share.

After the I.P.O., Philips Lighting is valued at €4.5 billion, including debt.

Philips said that 37.5 million shares were sold in the offering, representing 25 percent of the lighting business. Goldman Sachs and J. P. Morgan Securities were global co-coordinators for the offering.

Philips Lighting will begin trading on a conditional basis on the Euronext stock exchange in Amsterdam on Friday.

“I am pleased with the response of investors towards Philips Lighting and the successful pricing of the I.P.O.,” Frans van Houten, the Philips chief executive, said in a news release. “This strategic milestone will allow Royal Philips to focus on the fast‐growing health technology market.”

Philips first announced plans in 2014 to spin off the lighting business as it reshapes itself to focus on health care and technology.

If an overallotment of shares is fully exercised, Philips would own 71.25 percent of the lighting business following the offering. Philips has said it plans to fully sell down its ownership over the next several years.

Philips will receive proceeds of €750 million from the offering.

The lighting business includes divisions that produce traditional light bulbs and LED lamps and that design complete lighting systems. The business had about 34,000 employees and posted sales of €7.5 billion in 2015.

In April, Philips said that it was “actively engaging” with interested parties about the separate sale of its automotive and LED components business, Lumileds.

In January, Philips called off the sale of a controlling stake in the Lumileds business to GO Scale Capital, an investment fund sponsored by GSR Ventures of China and Oak Investment Partners, because of regulatory concerns raised in the United States.
