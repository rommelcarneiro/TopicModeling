Juan Manuel Martinez broke a tie midway through the second half, and Real Salt Lake beat New York City F.C., 3-2, on Thursday night in their first-ever meeting at Yankee Stadium.

Real Salt Lake (7-4-2) scored three goals in a third straight match and concluded a five-game road swing with a 2-3-0 record. N.Y.C.F.C. (4-5-6) is winless in its last four games.

N.Y.C.F.C. opened the scoring in the 56th minute when Jack Harrison scored his first M.L.S. goal on a deflected shot from distance. But Real Salt Lake tied the game three minutes later when Yura Movsisyan controlled a long ball and overpowered a defender to squeeze a shot inside the near post.

Real Salt Lake took a 2-1 lead when a failed clearance fell to the feet of the wide-open Martinez, then went up 3-1 in the 74th minute on Frederic Brillant’s own goal.

N.Y.C.F.C.’s David Villa slid a penalty kick under Real Salt Lake goalkeeper Nick Rimando in the 87th minute for his M.L.S.-leading 10th goal of the season.
