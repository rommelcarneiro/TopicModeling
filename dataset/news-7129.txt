DeMar DeRozan scored 30 points, Jonas Valanciunas had 15 rebounds and 10 points, and the Toronto Raptors beat the visiting Indiana Pacers, 89-84, on Sunday night for a Game 7 win that advanced them to the Eastern Conference semifinals.

Toronto will face the Miami Heat, who advanced by routing the Charlotte Hornets in Game 7 of their series. Game 1 will be Tuesday night in Toronto.

The Raptors rookie Norman Powell added 13 points, and Kyle Lowry had 11 points and 9 assists, as Toronto won a seven-game series for the first time in franchise history.

The victory gave the Raptors their first postseason series win since a five-game triumph over the Knicks in 2001 — and ended the N.B.A.’s longest active drought between playoff series wins.

Paul George led Indiana with 26 points and 12 rebounds, George Hill scored 19 points, and Monta Ellis had 15.

The Raptors led, 83-67, with 7 minutes 31 seconds left in the fourth quarter, but the Pacers staged a furious rally to get back in the game.

Indiana scored 12 of the next 14 points, cutting it to 85-79 with 3:23 remaining. The Pacers made it 85-82 on Ellis’s 3-pointer with 2:37 left, but Lowry answered with a driving layup.

George made two free throws with 52 seconds left to make it 87-84, but on the next possession he turned the ball over to DeRozan, who was fouled and made both free throws with 6.5 seconds left.

DeRozan’s 13 points in the first quarter were more than he had in either Game 4 or Game 6, when he scored 8 points. He made just one of five field-goal attempts in the second, but Powell came off the bench to score 10 points.

Toronto led by 58-46 after a 3 by Carroll at 8:17 of the third, but the Pacers answered with a 7-0 run. Patterson made a 3-pointer at 4:37, Toronto’s fourth of the quarter after three in the first half, and DeRozan scored the next 5 points in an 8-0 surge that gave the Raptors a 71-57 lead. DeRozan scored 13 points in the third.

HEAT 106, HORNETS 73 Goran Dragic scored 25 points, Gerald Green added 16, and Miami advanced to the second round of the Eastern Conference playoffs with an emphatic win over visiting Charlotte.

The Heat, who lost Chris Bosh at the All-Star break to a blood clot for a second consecutive year and watched the assistant coach Keith Smart deal with cancer treatment, had trailed in the series, three games to two, before winning two straight while facing elimination.

Dwyane Wade said that he had reflected on all the Heat had been through before tipoff and had realized it made them stronger.

“I’m not a prophet or anything,” Wade said, “but I knew we were winning this game.”

Luol Deng scored 15, Wade finished with 12 and Hassan Whiteside had 10 points, 12 rebounds and 5 blocks for the Heat, who have won their last four Game 7s.

Frank Kaminsky scored 12 for Charlotte. Courtney Lee added 11 and Nic Batum 10.

The Hornets’ two biggest stars, Kemba Walker and Al Jefferson, combined for 13 points on Sunday.

The Hornets had a chance to close out the Heat on their home floor in Game 6 but wasted the opportunity in a 97-90 loss. They never had a chance in Game 7.

Miami led by 12 at halftime and stretched it to 24 by the midpoint of the third quarter.

“In the third quarter, it got away from us,” Hornets Coach Steve Clifford said.
