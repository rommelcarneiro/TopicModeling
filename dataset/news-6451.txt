Meryl Streep has rarely played a role as fiercely defiant as that of Joanna in Robert Benton’s 1979 film, “Kramer vs. Kramer,” in which her character abruptly leaves her husband (Dustin Hoffman), an advertising executive, and young son to find herself. More than a year after the father and son have grown close, Joanna returns to claim the boy, and the couple become involved in a brutal custody battle. Ms. Streep won her first Academy Award for the role, which inspired one of her strongest, if not always sympathetic, performances. The movie, based on a novel by Avery Corman, reflected the feminist struggles of the period, and Ms. Streep didn’t shy away from playing Joanna as an angry, self-assertive woman.

The film, on Thursday, May 12, at the IFC Center, is the final selection in its series Becoming Meryl Streep and is being shown in conjunction with the publication of Michael Schulman’s biography “Her Again: Becoming Meryl Streep.” It will be followed by a book signing and a talk with Mr. Schulman and Mr. Benton.
