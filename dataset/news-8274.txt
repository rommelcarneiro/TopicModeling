Last summer’s East Coast debut of KCON — a celebration of Korean music, TV and culture — filled Prudential Center in Newark to capacity with about 10,000 fans swarming in to see popular bands like Girls’ Generation and Teen Top. And this inaugural event, KCON New York, was enough of a success to warrant a return.

The festival’s organizers announced that it will come back to Prudential Center, and to accommodate demand, it has expanded from one day to two, June 24 and 25. Its older, bigger sibling, KCON Los Angeles, is also returning July 29 to 31 to the Staples Center, where it attracts about 75,000 visitors.

In Newark, much of the programming will be similar to that at last year’s KCON event: panel talks, dance contests, and food and beauty-product demonstrations. The highlight, a concert with several performers, will take place both nights. BTS, a boy band whose members write their own music and lyrics, is the headlining act. Other participating bands include the female group Mamamoo, the 13-member Seventeen and the singer Ailee.

The headliner for KCON Los Angeles will be announced at a later date. So far, the nine-member girl group Twice, which achieved popularity with the music video “Like OOH-AHH,” has signed on as part of the festival’s lineup.
