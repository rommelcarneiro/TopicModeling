LOS ANGELES — Anyone who figured that the remake of “Ghostbusters” would become connected with Hillary Clinton’s presidential bid during parallel appearances on ”The Ellen DeGeneres Show” figured right.

The film’s stars and Mrs. Clinton were mostly interviewed separately. But Ms. DeGeneres could not resist having Kate McKinnon — one of the female Ghostbusters in Sony Pictures’ forthcoming film — in a bit with Mrs. Clinton.

Ms. McKinnon often portrays Mrs. Clinton on “Saturday Night Live.” Sometimes, she also portrays Ms. DeGeneres. On the “Ellen” show, which was taped on Tuesday and was aired Wednesday, Ms. McKinnon did side-by-side impersonations of both, and Ellen demanded to know which was more fun.

“Did I mention that I’m running to be the next president of the United States?” Mrs. Clinton asked, with a slight air of menace. Ms. McKinnon responded by wrapping her arm around a soon-beaming Mrs. Clinton.
