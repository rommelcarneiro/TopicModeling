Renewed concerns about economic growth abroad, specifically in Europe and China, weighed on the market on Tuesday, causing stocks to retreat from the previous day’s gains.

Stocks started lower and remained there most of the day. The Dow Jones industrial average moved down 100 to 200 points throughout the day. The Dow finished 140.25 points lower, or 0.8 percent, at 17,750.91.

The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index lost 18.06 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,063.37, and the Nasdaq composite lost 54.37 points, or 1.1 percent, to 4,763.22.

The selling started in Asia, when a Chinese purchasing managers’ index for manufacturing declined to 49.4 last month, from 49.7 in March. A number below 50 indicates that manufacturing is contracting.

Worries about China were largely responsible for a bout of turmoil in global financial markets early this year. Those concerns were compounded after European officials trimmed their economic growth forecasts for the 19 countries that share the euro currency, citing an unpredictable global outlook reflecting political uncertainty and weakness in emerging markets.

Although Europe’s economy was surprisingly strong in the first quarter, when it regained the size it was before the 2008 financial crisis, Pierre Moscovici, the European Union’s economic commissioner, said the recovery “remains uneven.”

The global economic worries caused more losses for two of the hardest-hit sectors in the United States stock market this year: energy and banks. Energy companies in the S.&P. 500 slumped 2.2 percent, the most in the index, and financial stocks fell 1.3 percent.

Chevron dropped $1.99, or 2 percent, to $101.32. JPMorgan Chase lost $1.23, or 2 percent, to $62.56. Goldman Sachs fell $3.04, or 1.8 percent, to $163.14.

Pfizer jumped 90 cents, or 3 percent, to $33.70 after the company reported solid first-quarter earnings that beat analysts’ estimates. Pfizer had big sales gains with some of its newest drugs, including Lyrica and the vaccine Prevnar 13.

In energy, benchmark United States crude oil lost $1.13, or 2.5 percent, to close at $43.65 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude fell 86 cents, or 1.9 percent, to close at $44.97 a barrel in London.
