Gov. Nikki R. Haley, a Republican, signed legislation Wednesday that immediately outlaws most abortions in South Carolina at 20 weeks beyond fertilization. The only exceptions are if the mother’s life is in jeopardy or a doctor determines the fetus cannot survive outside the womb. Doctors face up to $10,000 in fines and three years in prison for each violation; prison time is mandatory on a third conviction. These bans are now in effect in at least 13 states and blocked by court challenges in several others. Supporters cite the disputed claim that a fetus can feel pain at 20 weeks. Opponents say later-term abortions usually happen with wanted pregnancies that go horribly wrong. (AP)

A gunman armed with a rifle, body armor and extra ammunition opened fire at cars on a highway on the outskirts of Phoenix, leaving at least two people injured before the police captured him near a stolen vehicle that crashed into a ditch, the authorities said Wednesday. Police officials identified the suspect as James David Walker, 36, of San Tan Valley, Ariz. They said he was being booked on suspicion of attempted homicide, aggravated assault, endangerment, armed robbery, theft of means of transportation and possession of dangerous drugs with additional charges pending. He is suspected of carjacking a vehicle at a gas station and shooting at a state trooper’s cruiser during a manhunt Tuesday night that began when drivers began reporting that a man had fired at them. The officer was not injured, but one person was grazed on the head with a bullet and another was hit in the leg during the highway shootings. Six vehicles were struck by gunfire, including one trooper’s vehicle that was shot several times. The authorities said they believed the gunman was shooting from a vehicle or the side of State Route 87. There was no indication the gunfire was tied to shootings on Phoenix-area freeways that gained national attention last August and September. (AP)
