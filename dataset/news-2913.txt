Rafa Márquez and Héctor Herrera scored late goals to lift Mexico over Uruguay, 3-1, on Sunday night in Glendale, Ariz., in an opening-round Copa América Centenario match that began on a sour note: the wrong national anthem.

A vastly pro-Mexico crowd of 60,025 watched the matchup of what were considered the top teams in Group C.

Márquez’s close-range shot in the 84th minute broke a 1-1 tie, and Herrera scored on a header from just outside the net in extra time.

Mexico’s other score was an own-goal by Uruguay’s Alvaro Pereira four minutes into the match. Márquez’s goal came 10 minutes after Diego Godín’s header tied it for Uruguay at 1-1.

Chile’s national anthem was played instead of Uruguay’s during the prematch ceremonies, prompting the Uruguayan players to stand silently on the field at University of Phoenix Stadium, many with blank stares.

Copa América said the mistake was “a human error.”

Turnover Boosts Venezuela Josef Martínez slotted a left-footed shot under goalkeeper Andre Blake in the 15th minute and Venezuela beat 10-man Jamaica, 1-0, in a Group C opener in Chicago.

Martínez’s goal was set up by a Jamaican giveaway on a clearance attempt. Venezuela defender Rolf Feltscher intercepted and started a quick-hitting, four-pass combination that freed Martínez near the left corner of the 6-yard box. Jamaica midfielder Rodolph Austin was sent off in the 23rd minute after he received a straight red card for a studs-up tackle on Venezuela’s Tomás Rincón.

Michael Hector nearly tied it for Jamaica on a right-footed shot that hit the post in the 49th minute, and Blake had a diving save in the 70th minute to keep the deficit at one goal.
