The coffee culture has given rise to some classy new coffee liqueurs. From California, there’s Firelit, made by Jeff Kessinger using Blue Bottle’s method for cold-brewing single-origin coffee and blended with a California brandy. Each 1,000-liter batch uses a different Arabica coffee. The latest result, from Nepalese beans, has an earthy intensity and a dark chocolate aroma. The French entry, by Merlet, combines coffee brewed from Brazilian Arabica beans with Cognac, which definitely comes through on the palate. It also has a touch of sweetness: Firelit Coffee Liqueur, $34.99 for 750 milliliters from K&L Wine Merchants, klwines.com; Merlet C2 Café Liqueur, $17.99 for 375 milliliters, and $26.99 for 750 milliliters, from Ambassador Wines & Spirits, ambassadorwines.com.
