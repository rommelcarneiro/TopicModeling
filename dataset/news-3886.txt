Talujon, an adventurous percussion group, arrives at Roulette in Brooklyn on Thursday, June 2, with a program of works inspired by the shimmering sound of the Indonesian gamelan. John Cage’s “Haikai” takes structural cues from the haiku form, but you don’t need to know the scores to appreciate the spare, flickering ambiguity of the landscape.

Lou Harrison’s Concerto for Violin and Percussion Orchestra melds a soulful solo line (here played by Jennifer Choi) to an agile, glinting ensemble. An intriguing recent piece is Nick Brooke’s “The Traps,” written for six mini-gamelans, part electronic and part acoustic, that fit in attaché cases. (8 p.m., roulette.org.)

On Friday, the ensemble counter)induction gives the premiere of Douglas Boyce’s geology-inspired “Tethys,” featuring one of its members, the essential violinist Miranda Cuckson. Works by Kyle Bartlett and Ryan Streber round out the program at the Tenri Cultural Institute. (8 p.m., counterinduction.com.)
