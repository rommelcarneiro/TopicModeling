On a narrow street on Staten Island lined with mostly brick-and-siding duplexes, it was a conspicuous sight: A man pushing the body of an unconscious woman on a dolly.

On Friday, just after 7 a.m., the authorities said, someone called the Police Department. As officers arrived to Post Lane in the Mariners Harbor neighborhood on the island’s northern shore, the man with the dolly ran off.

The woman, who was described by the police as in her 20s or 30s, was pronounced dead by emergency workers at the scene, the authorities said. Her name has not been released. The medical examiner will determine the cause of death.

But investigators are trying to locate the man, Anthony Lopez, 31, who was last seen with her body.

Later on Friday, the police said Mr. Lopez’s connection to the woman remained unclear and released a mug shot of Mr. Lopez taken last month after he was arrested on a charge of fare evasion.
