ALBANY — Todd Kaminsky, a Democrat, has emerged as the winner of a State Senate race on Long Island, although his Republican opponent has still not conceded.

Election officials finished counting absentee ballots on Friday and determined that Mr. Kaminsky had won just over 50 percent of the vote and defeated the Republican, Chris McGrath, by some 862 votes. The vote must be certified before it is official.

The special election was held on April 19 to fill the seat left vacant after Dean G. Skelos, a Republican and the former Senate majority leader, was convicted on federal corruption charges.

“The results are as clear today as they were on election night: Todd Kaminsky was elected to a historic victory by the people of the South Shore,” said Evan Thies, a spokesman for Mr. Kaminsky.

Mr. Kaminsky declared victory immediately after the special election showed him ahead of Mr. McGrath by fewer than 800 votes. But Mr. McGrath declined to concede until some 3,000 absentee ballots could be counted. He also asked for election officials to recheck electronic voting machines.

E. O’Brien Murray, a spokesman for Mr. McGrath, issued a statement on Friday seeking to tie Mr. Kaminsky to an investigation into campaign donations in key Senate races by groups linked to New York City’s mayor, Bill de Blasio.

“Given the seriousness of the campaign finance issues and the potential criminality that has arisen regarding Todd Kaminsky’s campaign, we are continuing to review all options,” Mr. Murray said in the statement.

Potential next steps could include a petition for a full recount.

A victory for Mr. Kaminsky would give Democrats a one-seat Senate majority, but Republicans will probably retain control thanks to support from six Democrats who broke with their party to support them.
