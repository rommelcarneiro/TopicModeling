The official confirmation of Prince’s death by opioid overdose is likely to reverberate in Washington, where lawmakers are still trying to hammer out a deal on legislation attempting to stem a national crisis in abuse of those drugs.

“No one is immune,” Senator Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican and one of the main authors of the Senate legislation, said in a statement. “The heroin and prescription drug epidemic is devastating families and communities all over the country, and we need to get this bill to the president’s desk as quickly as possible.”

Lawmakers have exhibited widespread bipartisan agreement that Congress needs to take steps to improve drug treatment, to better control prescription drug distribution and to enhance training of emergency responders in treating overdoses. But progress on the legislation has been slowed by disputes over funding and by other maneuvering over legislation that members of both parties see as a selling point in the fall elections.

House and Senate negotiators have started preliminary talks on reconciling different versions of the opioid legislation that have been passed by the two chambers, and they now hope to produce a final package before the next recess, over the Fourth of July.

Prince’s death is likely to spur them on. High-profile drug fatalities have had that effect in the past. The death from a cocaine overdose of the college basketball star Len Bias in June 1986 is widely credited with starting the crackdown of those years that came to be known as the war on drugs.
