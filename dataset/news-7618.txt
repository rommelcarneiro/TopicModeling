The Army Corps of Engineers has cleared the way for the creation of a 2.4-acre park on a pier in the Hudson River, with construction planned to begin as soon as this summer, officials said on Wednesday.

The project, which is expected to cost $130 million, has been led and is being financed in large part by the billionaire Barry Diller. It would replace a deteriorating pier at West 13th Street in Hudson River Park; the plans call for a pier over the water that has enough room for a park with performance spaces and wooded walking paths with rolling hills.

The project was announced almost two years ago, but it had to be approved by multiple agencies, including the Corps of Engineers, which had to modify an existing permit for the reconstruction of the pier, and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, which issued its permit last month. The City Club of New York, a civic organization, sued to block the project until a new environmental review had been conducted and the Legislature had approved the project, but a judge in Manhattan dismissed its lawsuit earlier this month.

Hudson River Park runs along the West Side of Manhattan from 59th Street to Battery Place. On Wednesday, in a statement announcing the Corps’ decision, Madelyn Wils, the president and chief executive of the trust that runs the park, said that the group was “excited to be in a position to start construction.”

Still, the project’s critics have not given up, saying they will appeal the judge’s decision and challenge the permits. Richard D. Emery, a lawyer representing the City Club, said there were “very serious defects in the approvals of this project,” particularly the evaluation of its environmental effects.

“We cannot allow them without a fight to drive piles into the sediment and thereby irreparably change the bottom of the Hudson or that area of the Hudson,” Mr. Emery said.
