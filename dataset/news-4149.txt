LOS ANGELES — Johnie’s Coffee Shop Restaurant, the famous vacant, slant-roof, Googie-style former diner on the corner of Wilshire Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue here, is in the middle of a temporary makeover as a Bernie Sanders-themed media installation.

“We view this as an art piece,” said Howard Gold, who was busy on Wednesday afternoon painting and fixing at the former diner. It closed in 2000, but it is still available for film shoots.

The idea, said Mr. Gold, whose family owns the property, is to deck the place in Sanders murals, posters and diner-style logos — the Bernie Sanders chicken bucket faces Wilshire — then open on Thursday for a reception that is expected to draw artists, movie stars and Sanders supporters.

Mr. Gold and his associate, Jay Ponti, said they expected the actresses Shailene Woodley and Frances Fisher to be among the guests. They also expect Jeff Dowd, a film producer and political activist who is perhaps best known as being the real-life inspiration for The Dude, played by Jeff Bridges in “The Big Lebowski.”

Mr. Gold and Mr. Ponti said the gathering would not be a fund-raiser, though they might sell some buttons and shirts. Mostly, they said, it will be a chance to get attention for Mr. Sanders before the June 7 California presidential primary.

Kii Arens, who has created art for Radiohead, The Who and other bands, and Donny Miller are among the artists who contributed works, which include a large, multicolored Bernie mural that hollers from one of the diner’s windows.

The winking Bernie burger man on the front looks very much like Speedee, the original mascot for McDonald’s.

“Open 27 Hours” says the sign on the door. But Thursday’s event, Mr. Gold said, would most likely run from 7 to 9 p.m.
