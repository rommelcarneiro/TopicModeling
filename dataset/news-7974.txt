LONDON — GE Money Bank, a unit of GE Capital in the Czech Republic, said on Monday that its initial public offering could value the banking business at 39.1 billion Czech korunas, or about $1.6 billion.

The initial public offering is the latest in a series of moves by General Electric as it seeks to retreat from finance and focus on its industrial roots.

General Electric said last year that it planned to sell the bulk of GE Capital within two years. Since then, GE Capital has entered into agreements for asset sales worth about $165 billion.

The Czech business, which will be renamed Moneta Money Bank, said it planned to price its offering on the Prague Stock Exchange at 68 korunas to 85 korunas a share. That would value the bank at 39.1 billion korunas at the midpoint of the expected range. GE Capital will retain a minority stake in the Czech bank.

“We are pleased to be launching our planned I.P.O. today, after a strong initial response from institutional investors,” Tomas Spurny, the chief executive of GE Money Bank, said in a news release.

Plans to pursue an initial public offering for the Czech business were announced this month.

The bank, based in Prague, has 229 branches and 629 A.T.M.s in the Czech Republic. It serves 1.17 million retail and commercial customers in the country. The company posted a profit of 4.5 million korunas in 2015.

GE Capital plans to sell 260.6 million shares in Moneta Money Bank in the offering, or about 51 percent of the bank’s shares. Conditional trading of Moneta Money Bank is expected to begin in Prague on May 6.

Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase are serving as joint global coordinators on the offering.
