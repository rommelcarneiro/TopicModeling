WASHINGTON — The Clinton campaign on Wednesday released a 203-word statement largely dismissing the criticisms in the inspector general’s report on the email practices of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. It reprised many of the arguments Mrs. Clinton has made throughout the 14-month drama over her use of a personal email and server. Now, though, the statement can be compared directly with the findings in the 79-page report.

From the statement: “The inspector general documents just how consistent her email practices were with those of other secretaries and senior officials at the State Department who also used personal email.”

Only one other secretary of state — Colin L. Powell — exclusively used his personal email for official communications. Condoleezza Rice said she did not use personal or government email. Madeleine K. Albright did not use email, which was in its infancy when she was in the job. Secretary of State John Kerry said he occasionally used personal email, mostly to reply to people who emailed him on his personal account. But the report said that after discussing the issue with his aides and other staff members, “he began primarily using his department account to conduct official business.”

“The report shows that problems with the State Department’s electronic record-keeping systems were longstanding and that there was no precedent of someone in her position having a State Department email account until after the arrival of her successor.”

The report does acknowledge chronic issues with record keeping at the State Department. But it also traces how regulations were modified in the years between Ms. Albright and Mrs. Clinton to make sure digital communications were preserved for federal archives. More than once, State Department officials proposed setting up an official email address for Mrs. Clinton — in part so she could use two BlackBerrys. Her aide Huma Abedin rejected that, telling her colleagues, “It doesn’t make a whole lot of sense.”

“Contrary to the false theories advanced for some time now, the report notes that her use of personal email was known to officials within the department during her tenure, and that there is no evidence of any successful breach of the secretary’s server.”

That Mrs. Clinton used a private address was hardly a mystery to the dozens of people in the State Department, White House or other agencies who sent or received email from her. It is equally clear, however, that senior department officials were sensitive about people raising red flags about it. When two junior staff members expressed concerns to their boss in the Information Records Management office, he “instructed the staff never to speak of the secretary’s personal email system again.”

While the report does not find evidence that Mrs. Clinton’s server was breached, it notes that the Clintons’ outside I.T. consultant twice shut down the unit in the family home in Chappaqua, N.Y. – on Jan. 9 and 10, 2011 – because he feared that someone was trying to hack the system. “We were attacked again, so I shut down for a few min,” he wrote in an email to Ms. Abedin.

“We agree that steps ought to be taken to ensure the government can better maintain official records, and if she were still at the State Department, Secretary Clinton would embrace and implement any recommendations, including those in this report, to help do that.”

Among the inspector general’s recommendations is to remind employees regularly that the use of personal email for official business is discouraged, that they could incur penalties for doing so and that all departing officials, including the secretary of state, must sign a document pledging that they have turned over all federal records, including emails. Mrs. Clinton has admitted her use of a personal email was a mistake, but many of these regulations existed, in one form or another, when she was in office.

“As this report makes clear, Hillary Clinton’s use of personal email was not unique, and she took steps that went much further than others to appropriately preserve and release her records.”

Mrs. Clinton’s use of a private email and server stored in her home was, in fact, unique. She left the State Department without turning over any emails, and only did so after she was contacted by the department’s lawyers, who were under pressure to produce documents from the House Select Committee on Benghazi. The 55,000 pages of emails she delivered did not include anything from the first three months of her tenure.

Wednesday’s statement from the campaign does not repeat an assertion Mrs. Clinton has made before: that her arrangement, while unwise, was permitted. Last September, she told The Associated Press: “What I did was allowed. It was allowed by the State Department. The State Department has confirmed that.”

The report says Mrs. Clinton “had an obligation to discuss using her personal email account to conduct official business.” Had she done so, the department would not have approved her exclusive use of a personal email because of potential security risks and because of restrictions on the transmission of sensitive information. In fact, the State Department began disciplinary proceedings against an ambassador to Kenya, J. Scott Gration, for his use of a personal email account — in effect, mimicking the practice of his boss.
