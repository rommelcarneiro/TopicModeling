The actor Colin Farrell reads “Would My Heart Outrun Its Pursuer?” by Gary Presley, about a quadriplegic man who finds love with a female attendant.

You can also hear the episode on iTunes and Stitcher.

“The female attendants preferred to come in pairs, all the better to help a man into his bed, and there undress him,” Mr. Presley writes of his earlier life. “I am somewhat deferential in the company of women, and I had made a conscientious effort to avoid any touch, any word that might be construed as improper. With that the arrangement sailed along with no problems, soon settling into a job done and forgotten — at least until Belinda.”

Afterward, we’ll talk with Mr. Presley and his wife.
