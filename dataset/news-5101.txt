There is one supervillain who is no longer welcome at New York Comic Con: the dreaded Ticket Scalper. ReedPOP, which produces the show, has announced a new verification system that it hopes will reduce the number of tickets that fall into nefarious hands.

On Friday, May 20, fans will be able to create a profile at NewYorkComicCon.com/FanVerification to be eligible to buy tickets when they go on sale. Anyone who does not register by June 13 will be unable to buy tickets for this year’s convention, which will be held Oct. 6-9 at the Jacob J. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan.

As part of this change tickets will be available only through the convention website.

“New York Comic Con has now become one of the largest ticketed events in the city and as Spider-Man would say, with great power comes great responsibility,” Lance Fensterman, the global senior vice president of ReedPOP, said. “We believe this system will help us thwart predatory resellers and scalpers who drive up the price and put as many New York Comic Con tickets in the hands of the fans that made the show what it is.”

ReedPOP has also announced another change: its sister festival, New York Super Week, which begins a few days before the convention and takes place at sites around Manhattan and Brooklyn, will be renamed NYCC Presents.
