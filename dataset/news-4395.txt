Here’s one gala that won’t be hard to sell out: Jake Gyllenhaal has agreed to star in a one-night-only performance of “Sunday in the Park With George” to raise money for New York City Center.

Mr. Gyllenhaal, although best known as a film star, wowed musical theater fans last summer with his star turn in an Encores! Off-Center production of “Little Shop of Horrors” at City Center. And “Sunday in the Park,” with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and a book by James Lapine, is one of the most beloved shows in the musical theater canon. The show, a look at the artistic and romantic compromises faced by the painter Georges Seurat, won the Pulitzer Prize in 1985.

The concert performance is being produced by Jeanine Tesori, the Tony-winning composer of “Fun Home,” who is leaving her position as artistic director of Encores! Off-Center but continuing her relationship with City Center as an artistic adviser.

The gala, honoring the philanthropist Adrienne Arsht, is scheduled for Oct. 24; performance-only tickets will be sold, for $75 and up, beginning at noon on May 25 at nycitycenter.org. (Benefit tickets are considerably more expensive — $2,500 to $10,000, or $25,000 to $150,000 for a table.)
