LONDON — The International Airlines Group, the parent company of British Airways, said on Friday that it would trim its growth plans this year to adjust for weaker demand in the second quarter, as fewer people flew after last month’s attacks in Brussels.

Willie Walsh, the chief executive of International Airlines, said that the group, whose portfolio also includes Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus, would cut its plans for capacity growth in 2016 to 4.9 percent from 5.2 percent.

The Brussels attacks of March 22, which included explosions in the departure hall of Brussels Airport, have curbed appetite for travel, the group said.

“The trends going into the third quarter, however, appear to be back to normal,” Mr. Walsh told reporters on a call on Friday, saying he expected that quarter to be “strong.”

That is when International Airlines tends to make its biggest share of annual profit, as many Europeans go on vacation.

The group maintained its forecast for 2016 profit, however, saying that a plan to cut costs, excluding fuel, by about 1 percent this year would help it reach its target.

For the three months ended March 31, International Airlines posted underlying operating profit of 155 million euros, or $176 million, beating an average forecast of €145 million and helped by lower fuel prices and cost cuts.

Mr. Walsh said the Brussels attacks appeared to be having a “more pronounced” and “more extended” impact on travel demand than past shocks, in part because they happened so soon after the Paris attacks in November.

Shares in International Airlines were down 4.5 percent to 525 pence in morning trading in London, continuing a dismal run since the beginning of the year.

The stock has lost 13 percent since January, underperforming Britain’s benchmark stock index, which is flat.

Some analysts have blamed the risks associated with Britain’s vote on European Union membership, scheduled for June 23, for the stock’s performance. “The shares remain under the pall of the U.K.’s E.U. referendum,” said Damian Brewer, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in London.
