Jamie Vardy scored twice Saturday as Leicester City produced a swaggering 3-1 home victory over Everton in its first match as the English Premier League champion before collecting the trophy.

Leicester City, a 5,000-to-1 preseason long shot, produced the stylish, energetic display after having spent a week celebrating the clinching of its first top-flight title on Monday.

The only frustration was Vardy’s missing a hat trick when he fired high on his second penalty. Vardy scored five minutes in and again in the 65th minute for his 24th goal.

Sunderland beat visiting Chelsea, 3-2, to climb out of the relegation zone with two games remaining. Newcastle was held to a scoreless draw on the road by relegated Aston Villa, and Norwich was below Newcastle in the relegation zone after losing to visiting Manchester United, 1-0.

Elsewhere, host West Ham lost to Swansea, 4-1; Bournemouth drew at home with West Bromwich Albion, 1-1; and Crystal Palace beat visiting Stoke, 2-1.

FOUR STRAIGHT FOR BAYERN Robert Lewandowski scored twice for Bayern Munich to clinch a fourth successive Bundesliga title with a 2-1 win at Ingolstadt.

Lewandowski opened the scoring with a penalty in the 15th minute, after Franck Ribéry was brought down by Marvin Matip, and he claimed his 29th goal of the season not long after with a precise strike inside the far post after a brilliant through ball from Xabi Alonso.

Moritz Hartmann pulled one back with another penalty — conceded by Alonso — before the break, but Bayern never seemed to be in danger of missing out on its record 25th Bundesliga title and its 26th German championship over all.

Borussia Dortmund’s 1-0 loss at relegation-threatened Eintracht Frankfurt meant that even a defeat would have been enough for Bayern. Dortmund’s 77 points were a record for a second-place team in the Bundesliga, which began in 1963.

Stefan Aigner’s early header proved enough for Frankfurt to climb out of the relegation zone, 1 point above Werder Bremen in the relegation playoff spot after its scoreless draw at Cologne.

Stuttgart lost, 3-1, at home to Mainz to move a step closer to relegation. Stuttgart was 3 points below Frankfurt with Wolfsburg next.

Darmstadt secured survival in its first season back in the Bundesliga with a 2-1 come-from-behind win at Hertha Berlin that all but ended Hertha’s Champions League hopes.

Andre Hahn scored twice as host Borussia Mönchengladbach came from behind to beat Bayer Leverkusen, 2-1, and all but secure the Champions League playoff spot.

TIGHT RACE IN SPAIN The Spanish league title race is reaching its climax with two rounds left and only 1 point separating the top three teams. Barcelona is ahead of Atlético Madrid on head-to-head goals, and both have a 1-point lead over Real Madrid. The three teams play Sunday.

Barcelona will host Espanyol knowing that a win combined with an Atlético loss and a draw by Madrid would secure a second straight title.

SPORTING LISBON LEADS Sporting Lisbon’s 5-0 win over Setubal lifted it into first place over Benfica, ensuring that the Primeira Liga championship in Portugal will be decided in next weekend’s final games. Gelson Martins scored twice for Sporting.
