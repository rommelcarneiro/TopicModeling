Own your differences, the empowerment mantra says. No one is doing that more hilariously than Brad Williams, who gets his second Showtime comedy special on Friday, May 20. Mr. Williams uses his dwarfism both for self-deprecation and to expose the daily prejudices and misconceptions he encounters. “Here’s how I write jokes,” he said in his first Showtime special, “Fun Size,” last year. “Step 1: Be a dwarf. Step 2: Wait.” In the new special, “Daddy Issues,” he serves up a rollicking story about running a race in the Special Olympics and chastises the men in the audience over which urinal not to use in a public bathroom. And he finishes the set with anecdotes about his father that are both funny and penetrating. “I’m so thankful that he put a little adversity in my life,” he says. “That way I knew how to conquer adversity later. You have to ask yourself one question: Who do you want your kid to be? Do you want your kid to be ready for the world that is, or for the world that should be?”
