Wholesome Wave, a nonprofit organization founded by the chef Michel Nischan to make healthful, affordable food available to underserved neighborhoods, is selling wine as a fund-raiser. Mr. Nischan had his friend the chef Jacques Pépin paint the label for the wine, which is being produced by One Hope, a winery in the Edna Valley of California. The 2012 pinot noir with scents of blueberry and lilac is complex and robust. It is making its debut at a benefit for the organization honoring Mr. Pépin on Wednesday in New York: One Hope 2012 Edna Valley Reserve Pinot Noir, $75, onehopewine.com/shop/2012-jacques-pepin.
