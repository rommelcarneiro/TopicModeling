A teenager died on Wednesday while swimming at Rockaway Beach in Queens in what officials said was the first drowning of the year at a public city beach, just days before lifeguards would take their posts for the summer season.

The authorities were called shortly after 2:30 p.m. to the boardwalk near 67th Street, where, the police said, a 19-year-old man was struggling in the water. Teams of divers and boats were sent to look for him. Divers from the New York Fire Department found him unconscious and unresponsive after he had been in the water for nearly an hour, the authorities said.

The man was taken to St. John’s Episcopal Hospital in Far Rockaway, where he was pronounced dead, the authorities said. His name has not been released.

The swimming season at the city’s public beaches begins on Saturday, with the Memorial Day weekend. During the season, lifeguards are stationed on the beaches from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
