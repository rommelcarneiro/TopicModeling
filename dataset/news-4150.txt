With his signature cheerful demeanor increasingly at odds with the situation he finds himself in, Speaker Paul D. Ryan is pressing ahead with unveiling his House-drafted policy agenda, even if it seems most people just want to talk to him about Donald J. Trump. Mr. Ryan, who has ordered House Republicans to come up with policy papers in six areas, said on Wednesday that the rollout of those ideas would begin after the Memorial Day break.

The first of the policy proposals, which will constitute the House’s “Confident America” agenda, will focus on combating poverty, Mr. Ryan said. He added that each policy area, including national security and taxes, would be tackled less with the amorphous ideas that he has been batting around for months, but with an extensive legislative framework.

“We’re not talking about principles here,” Mr. Ryan said. “This is substance. It’s going to be a clear explanation of the policy changes that are needed in these areas.”

He declined to give further details, saying he wanted relevant committee leaders to get their day in the sun when the ideas are brought out in the coming weeks.

What they will not be, most likely, are things that will be turned into actual pieces of legislation. “That’s really not the goal,” Mr. Ryan told reporters. He noted that a Republican would be needed in the White House to make them a reality. A continuation of divided government will not help Mr. Ryan and his fellow Republicans achieve their policy dreams, he conceded.

Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, has been kept abreast of their plans, he said, even though the New York businessman and reality TV star remains at odds with many House Republicans on myriad policy matters.

Presented with the notion that Republican primary voters seemed more interested in Mr. Trump’s approach to issues than those of House Republicans, Mr. Ryan noted, “We’re a big tent party.”
