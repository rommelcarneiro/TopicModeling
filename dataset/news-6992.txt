Bill Yosses, best known as a former pastry chef at the White House, is turning out savories as well as sweets. He has started a company, Perfect Pie, that makes and sells pies, including a hearty chicken potpie with truffles, beef-tamale-chile pie in a cornmeal crust, smoked duck and collard pie with several cheeses, an open-faced tomato and cheese tart, and a vegan turmeric tofu and vegetable pie in a millet crust. Pecan, apple and huckleberry are some of the dessert pies. Individual-size ones, $7.50, are sold at Brooklyn Roasting Companyâ€™s cafes, most notably the spacious new one in the Flatiron district. By summer, the pies will also be available online and full-size ones will be added, for $40 each: Brooklyn Roasting Company, brooklynroasting.com; Perfect Pie, 212-410-3262, perfectpie.com.
