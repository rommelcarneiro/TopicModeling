Is the landmark Serbian Orthodox Cathedral of St. Sava in Manhattan going to be demolished?

Not so fast.

The 161-year-old church building was gutted on May 1 in a tremendous blaze, captured in dramatic photos and videos, that devastated New York City’s Serbian community, for whom the church had been a spiritual home since the 1940s.

All that remains on the church site, just west of Madison Square Park, is a Gothic Revival shell open to the sky — reminiscent in a small way of Coventry Cathedral in England.

Despite reports that the city had ordered the ruins to be taken down, the Buildings Department said on Tuesday that the investigation of the “compromised” structure was not finished and that no decision had been reached on the next steps.

“We don’t see that it’s impossible to stabilize the structure and preserve what remains while ensuring that public safety is not compromised,” Alexander Schnell, a spokesman for the agency, said.

On Sunday, the cathedral posted a bulletin on its website that read, “As the remaining church walls are determined to be unstable during inclement weather and winds exceeding 25 m.p.h., the D.O.B. has, based on engineering recommendation, reached a decision to demolish the church.”

The New York Post picked up the report on Tuesday, saying the cathedral “will be demolished by order of the city.”

However, Mr. Schnell said, “We have not reached that decision.”

The brownstone Gothic Revival church was designed by Richard Upjohn and completed in 1855 as a chapel of ease for Trinity Church in Lower Manhattan. It was designated an official city landmark in 1968.

Because of its landmark status, an extra layer of scrutiny would apply to any request by the cathedral for permission to demolish the building under an emergency declaration from the buildings agency.

“The situation — as we see it right now — does not pose a hazard to the public,” Mr. Schnell said.
