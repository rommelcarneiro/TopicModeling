TOPEKA, Kan. — On the last day of their annual session, Kansas legislators wrangled Wednesday over whether to comply with a court-ordered increase in aid to poor school districts amid fresh evidence of the state’s deteriorating finances.

Leaders of the Legislature’s Republican supermajorities considered whether to debate a school finance bill before lawmakers formally adjourned. But they backed off after it appeared there was no consensus on what to do.

The state Supreme Court on Friday rejected some education funding changes enacted earlier this year by lawmakers. The justices said that the school finance system remained unfair to poor school districts and warned lawmakers that public schools would be unable to open after June 30 if no action was taken.

A few Republican senators wanted to pass a bill on Wednesday to increase aid to poor school districts. Others wanted more time to draft a response, which would require Gov. Sam Brownback to call a special session. Others wanted to defy the justices.

Mr. Brownback, a Republican, would not say Wednesday night whether he would call a special session. He issued a statement promising to work with legislators and the state’s attorney general to respond “aggressively” to any action to close schools.

Lawmakers also received more bad news about state finances. The Department of Revenue reported that tax collections in May fell $74.5 million short of expectations. The state may have to delay paying some bills or take other steps to avoid a budget deficit.

Kansas has struggled to balance its budget since Republican legislators cut personal income taxes at Mr. Brownback’s urging in 2012 and 2013.
