Ursula M. Burns, the first black woman to run a Fortune 500 company, will not be chief executive at Xerox after the company splits in two later this year, the company says.

Ms. Burns, 57, became head of Xerox in 2009. She has spent her entire career at the company, working her way up from an internship in 1980. She was president of the company before being named chief executive.

Xerox said on Friday that after the split, Ms. Burns will become the chairwoman of a newly formed document technology company, which will include its printer and copier businesses. The second company will focus on business process outsourcing, providing payment processing and other services.

Xerox, based in Norwalk, Conn., said it was searching for chief executives for both companies.

Xerox announced in January that it would separate into two independent publicly traded companies after being pressured by the activist investor Carl C. Icahn, who argued that separate companies would be more valuable.

Shares of Xerox Corporation rose 9 cents to $9.14 on Friday.
