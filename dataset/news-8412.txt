WASHINGTON — The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell unexpectedly last week, hitting its lowest level since 1973, the Labor Department said on Thursday. While another report showed a mild weakening in factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region in April, manufacturers were fairly upbeat about business prospects in the next six months.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 6,000 to a seasonally adjusted 247,000 for the week ended April 16, the lowest reading since November 1973, the Labor Department said.

Jobless claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with healthy labor market conditions, for 59 weeks, the longest stretch since 1973. That labor market strength comes despite signs that growth stumbled in the first quarter.

The economy has been hurt by a strong dollar and weak global demand, which have eroded exports. Lower oil prices are also a constraint, as they have undercut the profits of energy companies, leading them to cut spending on capital projects.

In a separate report on Thursday, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said that its business conditions index fell to minus 1.6 this month, from a reading of 12.4 in March. But the survey’s indicators of future activity showed continued improvement, with rising expectations for increases in orders, shipments and factory jobs.

The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends because it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 4,500 to 260,500 last week.

The claims report covered the survey week for April nonfarm payrolls. The four-week average of claims rose 1,000 between the March and April survey periods, implying another strong month of employment gains. Payrolls increased 215,000 in March.

“This continued strength in the labor market supports our forecast for a modest rebound in consumer spending growth in the second quarter, but it also suggests that wage and inflation pressures will continue to build,” said Jesse Edgerton, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.

The claims report also showed that the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 39,000 to 2.14 million in the week ended April 9, the lowest level since November 2000. The four-week average of the so-called continuing claims was also the lowest since November 2000.
