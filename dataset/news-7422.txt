So long Angelina, hello Alicia.

Alicia Vikander will play Lara Croft in a coming film version of “Tomb Raider,” based on the video game series about a grave-and-ruin-roving archaeologist who faces down foes around the world.

Angelina Jolie starred in two movies based on the games; the first was released in 2001, the second in 2003

The Hollywood Reporter first reported the news of Ms. Vikander’s role. A publicist for Ms. Vikander confirmed the casting in an email Friday.

Ms. Vikander, who is 27 and from Sweden, had a breakout year last year, starring in “Ex Machina,” “The Man From U.N.C.L.E.” and “The Danish Girl,” for which she won the Oscar for best supporting actress.
