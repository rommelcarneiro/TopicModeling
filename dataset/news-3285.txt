For seven years Makenzie Vega played the central family’s daughter on “The Good Wife,” a critically acclaimed series in which her character, Grace Florrick, often struggled with her parents’ actions and decisions. On Friday Ms. Vega turns up in a much more lowbrow offering, and in this one her character’s parents do something far worse than anything the Florricks ever did: They leave her home alone when there’s a homicidal maniac on the loose.

In “Fender Bender,” a made-for-TV horror movie on Chiller, Ms. Vega acquits herself well in a thin story that will make you think twice about swapping contact information with the guy who just dinged your car.

That’s what her teenage character, Hilary, dutifully does when she bangs fenders with a seemingly polite gentleman while driving her mother’s car. Her annoyed parents condemn her to staying home while they take a family trip, and basic horror-movie stuff ensues as the polite gentleman (Bill Sage) turns out not to be so polite.

This low-budget film, a Shout! Factory production written and directed by Mark Pavia, doesn’t make nearly enough use of Ms. Vega’s abilities. But she does have one tasty scene in which she tells off a philandering boyfriend with gusto.

Apart from that, the film is aiming for the mindless horror of drive-in movie days, and at that it succeeds. But it doesn’t find any new ways to be scary and instead relies on tried-and-true frights. Fewer ominous tracking shots and more story and dialogue would have been welcome. Besides Ms. Vega, the best thing in the movie is the boogeyman’s scary mask.
