MOSCOW — With President Vladimir V. Putin looking on, Russia’s space agency was forced to postpone the inaugural launch of a rocket from the Vostochny Cosmodrome in the Far East on Wednesday, citing an unspecified last-minute technical glitch.

But by Thursday morning, technicians had apparently resolved the problem, and the unmanned Soyuz rocket carrying three satellites blasted off from the launching pad, according to the Russian space agency and the Kremlin.

The new launch site, which is near the border with China, has been plagued by scandals over embezzlement, unpaid wages and construction delays.

Mr. Putin had flown to the space center to watch the liftoff and planned to stay an extra day.

“Russia remains a leader in the number of launches, it is a fact, this is good,” Mr. Putin said Wednesday at a meeting with space officials broadcast on state television. “But we encounter a large number of mishaps. This is bad, and there should be a professional and prompt reaction.”

This was not the first time that Russia’s space program had suffered a technical problem with Mr. Putin serving as a prominent spectator. In June 2014, the launching of a new rocket was aborted while the event was being broadcast live on television, with Mr. Putin watching.

The Kremlin built the new Vostochny site to reduce Russia’s dependence on the Soviet-era Baikonur Cosmodrome, which is in Kazakhstan.
