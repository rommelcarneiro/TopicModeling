Members of the Revolution, the music group that Prince founded in 1979, and which disbanded in 1986, have announced on Facebook that they planned to reunite for live performances after the pop star’s death last week.

“We have decided, after spending three or four days together now grieving over the loss of Prince, that we would like to come out and do some shows,” Wendy Melvoin, who played guitar and sang with the band, said in the video, which was released on Tuesday. Ms. Melvoin did not specify when or where the shows would take place, simply saying it would be “soon.”

The video, posted on the Facebook page of the bassist Mark Brown (known as BrownMark), shows five people introducing themselves as Ms. Melvoin, Lisa Coleman, Bobby Z, BrownMark and Matt Fink, the band members on the “Purple Rain” album.

But they were impostors, The Minneapolis Star Tribune said, quickly replaced by the real musicians, “the kind of levity Prince himself was known for behind the scenes.”

According to the newspaper, the video was shot Sunday night at the Cosmos Bar in the Loews Hotel in downtown Minneapolis, where almost 100 of Prince’s close friends had gathered. The Revolution has reunited on other occasions, including in 2003 and 2012, for benefit performances.
