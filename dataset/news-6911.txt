Antoine Griezmann scored on Tuesday to send Atlético Madrid to the Champions League final for the second time in three years despite a 2-1 defeat at Bayern Munich.

Atlético, which lost to its rival Real Madrid in the 2014 final, progressed on the away-goals rule with an aggregate semifinal score of 2-2, having won the first leg in Madrid, 1-0.

Atlético’s Fernando Torres had a scoring chance with a late penalty kick but was denied by Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer.

Atlético’s keeper, Jan Oblak, saved a penalty kick from Thomas Müller in the first half, minutes after Bayern’s Xabi Alonso had leveled the matchup with a free kick in the 31st minute.

Griezmann scored in the 54th to put Atlético in the driver’s seat, but Bayern’s Robert Lewandowski scored in the 74th.

Atlético will play either Manchester City or Real Madrid in the final in Milan on May 28.

RONALDO SET TO RETURN Real Madrid, which has a nearly perfect home record, will welcome Manchester City on Wednesday for the second leg of their Champions League semifinal and will get a boost with the return of Cristiano Ronaldo, who missed three games because of a leg injury, including a 0-0 first-leg draw last week. Ronaldo leads the Champions League with 16 goals, one short of the record he set during the 2013-14 season.

TWO FACE DISCIPLINE The English Football Association charged Manchester United midfielder Marouane Fellaini and Leicester defender Robert Huth with violent conduct after they clashed during a Premier League game on Sunday.
