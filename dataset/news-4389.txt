For such a tiny part of Facebook, its Trending Topics feature sure has become a major headache.

On Monday, Facebook responded to Congressional questions about how it controls what people see in that little box to the right of their Facebook pages and whether conservative voices were being suppressed.

Facebook’s response can be boiled down to a simple sentiment: You got us all wrong. But the Silicon Valley company also plans to make some changes, particularly in the use of a handful of mainstream news outlets to push certain topics into the feed.

The increasing control of one company on how news is consumed is, of course, reason for concern. But Facebook users who rarely notice the Trending Topics feed may be scratching their heads at the hubbub over such little links, when the real action on Facebook is in its newsfeed.

And then there are those who think the combination of algorithms and editors that influence the Trending Topics list — which is often a mix of hard news, celebrity pandering and shark attack videos — are not exactly understanding the audience. Who, you may ask, is Ginger Zee? Chumlee? Is drone footage of a tiger shark feeding on a whale carcass off the coast of Australia really that cool?

After Facebook deals with the political questions surrounding Trending Topics, it may be time to address the usefulness issue.
