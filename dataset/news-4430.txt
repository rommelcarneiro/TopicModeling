Since 2010, Kneeland Co. has been an under-the-radar resource for vintage textiles for fashion and interior designers including Isabel Marant, Ralph Lauren Home and Tory Burch. Its founder, the Los Angeles-based creative consultant and Joanna Williams, often travels to far-flung places to find inspiration — including a dead-stock warehouse in her native Texas or stalls along the banks of the Ganges.

But her roots continue to bring her back to Mexico City. “My great-grandfather built three homes in the city next to one another, and my mother and her 9 siblings were raised there by my Mexican grandmother and my late Irish grandfather, who was a great explorer and instilled a huge sense of travel and adventure in the family,” says Williams, who named her company in his honor.

So when Anthropologie asked if she would create a collection of home goods inspired by the city, she jumped at the chance. “I can find inspiration on every corner in Mexico City,” she says. “I especially love the old fonts used in signage that you see on colonial buildings and businesses that have been open for decades. I love the neighborhood food markets with their colors and aromas and giant piñatas hanging from the ceilings, and the overflowing flower markets.”

To get inspiration for the collection, she headed south and gathered odds and ends: ribbons, postcards, embroidery samplers and goods. The resulting baskets, bedsheets, bath towels and shower curtain capture the spirit of her home away from home. “For the baskets, I was inspired by the color blocking that Luis Barragán is known for,” she said, referring to the late Mexican architect. “He appreciated and understood the rich heritage of craft and color and used both to create a modern home filled with art, music and decorative objects.” She adds: “I wanted something clean, fresh and modern while still being able to infuse the handmade elements that you see throughout the various communities in Mexico.”
