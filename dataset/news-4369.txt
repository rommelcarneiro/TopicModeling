I came into an offset smoker recently, a leaky old fellow with rust spots and broken wheels. It’s not fancy. The fire goes in one chamber and you put soaked wood chips on top of it, and then the smoke runs through a second chamber to cook and flavor whatever it is you’ve got in there.

I don’t think it cost $200 new, and I bet it lasts another 10 years before it needs to go to the dump.

I’ve smoked pork butts and pork ribs in it, legs of lamb: magnificent. But I haven’t yet improved on a dish I backed into accidentally during the first week I had the rig.

I had a mess of chicken wings. I bathed them in smoke for about 15 minutes before panicking that they would taste like stubbed-out cigarettes. I opened the top of the smoker and got them out of there. They were pale gold, the color of chamois. They looked almost delicious.

So I put them on a regular grill over medium heat and basted them with a thinned-out barbecue sauce and cooked them crisp. It took another 15 minutes. The result was astonishing: smoky but not aggressively so, deeply flavorful, the best thing I’d eaten in weeks.

Smoked chicken wings are now in regular rotation for summer 2016. The following recipe will show you how to make them, even if you don’t have a smoker.
