If you’re a New Yorker — and not a member of the 1 percent — the odds are that you’ve made a Faustian bargain to secure a room of your own in this overcrowded, overpriced city. Philip Ridley’s juicy little thriller “Radiant Vermin,” which begins previews as part of the Brits Off Broadway Festival, may be just for you.

The story follows one young couple’s twisting route to acquiring their dream home — and since this is a work by Mr. Ridley, whose comedy comes exclusively in shades of black, you can expect the moral compromises portrayed to involve a bit more than cash under the table. David Mercatali directs this London import from the man whose sensational futurist fable “Mercury Fur” gave shivery new meaning to the idea of partying down.
