Two men have been arrested in connection with the fatal shooting this week of a college student in Newark during a break-in at his fraternity house, the authorities said on Friday.

Prosecutors in Essex County, N.J., said Nafee Cotman, 18, and Taquan Harris, 22, both faced charges of murder, robbery, burglary and weapons-related offenses in the killing of Joseph Micalizzi, a junior at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, inside the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity house on Monday.

Bail for Mr. Cotman was set at $1 million, prosecutors said. Mr. Harris was awaiting arraignment on Friday night. Information regarding their lawyers was not immediately available.

The authorities said the two men had broken into the house, in the University Heights section of Newark, around 3 a.m. on Monday. They encountered Mr. Micalizzi, a 23-year-old mechanical engineering student from Freehold, N.J., and shot him. He was taken to University Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

Mr. Micalizzi’s death was the second time in a month that a college student had been fatally shot in off-campus housing in the neighborhood. On April 10, Shani Patel, a 21-year-old Rutgers student, was killed and his roommate was wounded in a shooting at their apartment near the university’s Newark campus, the authorities said. A suspect, Marcus Feliz, 25, was arrested and charged a few days later.
