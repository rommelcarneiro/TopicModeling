For the second year in a row, Polina Semionova, a principal dancer at American Ballet Theater, is withdrawing from its spring season at the Metropolitan Opera House, the company announced this week. It said she would be taking a medical leave, but did not elaborate.

Ballet Theater said that Ms. Semionova would be replaced by Hee Seo in Frederick Ashton’s “Sylvia,” on Tuesday and May 14; by Devon Teuscher in Alexei Ratmansky’s “Symphony #9,” on May 17 and May 21; by Gillian Murphy in “Swan Lake,” on June 13, and by Isabella Boylston in “Swan Lake” on June 18; and by Ms. Seo in “Romeo and Juliet,” on June 24.

Born in Moscow, Ms. Semionova studied at the Bolshoi Ballet Academy, joined the Berlin State Opera ballet as a principal at 17, made her debut with Ballet Theater in 2011, and joined the company the following year as a principal dancer. She missed the Met season last year after being sidelined by an injury.
