It is Disney’s multiplex. The rest of Hollywood just visits once in awhile.

Following the blockbuster successes of “Zootopia,” “The Jungle Book” and “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” Disney released “Captain America: Civil War” over the weekend, and the results were predictably massive: “Civil War,” which received strong reviews, sold an estimated $181.8 million in tickets at theaters in North America; it has already collected an additional $496.6 million overseas.

Turnout at Imax theaters, both at home and abroad, was particularly strong.

Disney has now had the No. 1 movie in the United States and Canada in 11 of the last 21 weekends, and some box office analysts predict “Civil War” will remain the top draw for the next two weekends. After that, a new movie — also from Disney — may well take over the top slot: “Alice Through the Looking Glass.” Not long after, Disney will release one of the summer’s most anticipated movies: “Finding Dory,” a sequel to Pixar’s “Finding Nemo.”

“Civil War” cost about $250 million to make, not including marketing costs. It introduces movie audiences to a new Marvel superhero, Black Panther, played by Chadwick Boseman. “Great reviews, great social media buzz and long-term global playability will add up to major box office returns over the long haul,” Paul Dergarabedian, a senior media analyst at comScore, said in an email on Sunday.

“Civil War” kicked off moviedom’s all-important summer season, which stretches from the first weekend in May until Labor Day. This time around, studios will introduce at least 16 films with production costs of $100 million or more (sometimes much more), compared with 10 last year. With that many giants fighting for attention, some analysts have warned of cannibalism.

“It is difficult to envision a scenario in which a significant number of this summer’s releases are not money-losers, or at least disappointments,” Doug Creutz, an analyst at Cowen and Company, wrote in a research note on Thursday.
