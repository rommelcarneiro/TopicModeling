By her count, Maryam Nassirzadeh has accumulated 35,000 photos on her iPhone in the past year and a half. “I am into documenting and keeping memories, though I do try to be in-the-moment,” says the designer and owner of an eponymous (and popular) Lower East Side shop and e-commerce site, describing her constant chronicling as “more of a joy than a chore. I find so many sources of inspiration and the pictures are good reference tools — and great to share with others. Taking them has become a part of my day, and of me.”

Her habit translated seamlessly into a travel diary that depicts what has become an annual springtime pilgrimage to Mexico, starting in 2007, when her parents purchased a home in Puerto Vallarta. Along with her husband, the photographer and artist Uday Kak, and their daughters Anais and Lune, ages 5 and 3, Nassirzadeh admired the grounds at the Ethnobotanical Garden in Oaxaca, where she and Kak married six years ago (and where the girls had never been). They also picked out pottery and textiles from local artisans, scooped up flea-market treasures and filled up on mozzarella salad and squash soup. Before returning to New York, Nassirzadeh went — solo — to Casa Luis Barragán, the late architect and engineer’s home and studio, a feast for her eyes (and iPhone). Here, she gives T an exclusive look at her recent sojourn.
