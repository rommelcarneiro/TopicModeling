The Rolex Mentor and Protégé Arts Initiative, a program that pairs major figures in seven disciplines with emerging artists, has announced those chosen for the 2016-17 cycle of the program, which began in 2002.

The pairings are intended to help foster a new generation of exceptional talent and expose the protégés to the experience and work practices of the mentors. The protégés must be professionals in their fields, and each receives a stipend of 25,000 Swiss francs (about $26,000) and is eligible for an equivalent amount at the end of the year to support the creation of new work.

The chosen protégés are Simon Kretz, a Swiss architect and urbanist, for architecture; Londiwe Khoza, of South Africa, for dance; the Indian director Chaitanya Tamhane, for film; Julián Fuks, a Brazilian writer and translator, for literature; Pauchi Sasaki, a Peruvian violinist, composer and performance artist, for music; Matías Umpierrez, an Argentine experimental director, for theater; and the Vietnamese painter and performance artist Thao-Nguyen Phan, for visual arts.

Their mentors, announced in December, are David Chipperfield (architecture), Mia Couto (literature), Alfonso Cuarón (film), Philip Glass (music), Joan Jonas (visual art), Robert Lepage (theater) and Ohad Naharin (dance). Each has chosen his or her protégé from a shortlist drawn up by a committee of experts in each discipline, and each must agree to spend at least 30 days in the next year working with the protégé.

“This year the geographical diversity is really great,” Rebecca Irvin, who directs the program for Rolex, said in a telephone interview. “It’s the first time we’ve had protégés from India and Vietnam, and the first time we’ve had female protégés in dance and visual arts. This year brings to 50 the number of young artists we’ve had in the program, a pretty big milestone.”
