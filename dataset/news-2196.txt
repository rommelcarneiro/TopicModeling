To the Editor:

In her otherwise insightful article (“No Passion? Don’t Panic,” Preoccupations, June 5), Angela Duckworth takes too narrow a view of enduring career passions.

As far as I know, Einstein didn’t ask how his research would directly benefit other people. Neither did Richard Feynman and many other great scientists and technologists. Their passion grew out of love of the subject itself and a belief that it was intrinsically important — and perhaps a belief that the intrinsic importance would “make the world a better place,” if only indirectly.
