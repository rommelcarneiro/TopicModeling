Concerns over the Zika virus have forced this month’s Pirates-Marlins series out of Puerto Rico, with the two games moving to Miami.

Major League Baseball and the players’ union announced Friday that Pittsburgh and Miami would meet May 30 and 31 at Marlins Park.

The union had asked Commissioner Rob Manfred to move the games after players expressed fears about getting and possibly transmitting the Zika virus.

The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said Zika can cause the birth defect microcephaly, which results in an unusually small head and a damaged brain. The virus is most often spread by mosquito bites, but it also can be spread through sexual intercourse.

Puerto Rico has had 785 confirmed Zika cases, including its first death from the virus.

The C.D.C. had spoken to players and staff members from both teams about the potential risks.

“It was a tough decision for us, it was a tough issue,” Pirates pitcher Gerrit Cole said. “In the end, after the thorough presentation by the C.D.C., there was just significant concerns for players and players’ families potentially expecting kids and people who may or may not be pregnant.”

A statement released by the league and the union said: “Players who objected to the trip because of their specific family situations should not be forced to travel to Puerto Rico. Because too many regulars on both clubs fell into that category, Commissioner Manfred had no choice but to relocate the games.”
