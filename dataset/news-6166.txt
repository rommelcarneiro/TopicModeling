Carrying a loaded gun in a backpack strapped to one’s body is no different from carrying it in one’s clothing, and both are illegal in public, the California Supreme Court ruled on Monday. Under California law, it is a crime in to carry a loaded firearm on one’s person in public, and the court ruled unanimously that there was no distinction between clothing that is being worn and a backpack, fanny pack or other container strapped to the body.

A Miami-Dade circuit judge declared on Monday that Florida’s new death penalty law was unconstitutional because it did not require a unanimous jury decision. The ruling, by Judge Milton Hirsch, applies only to Florida’s 11th Circuit, and no other judge is bound by it. A spokesman for Miami-Dade’s state attorney said the state would appeal. Florida had to revise its law after the United States Supreme Court ruled on Jan. 12 that it was unconstitutional because it gave too much power to judges while juries played only an advisory role in recommending the death penalty. The new law requires a 10-to-2 jury vote for the penalty to be imposed. Florida and Alabama remain the only states that do not require unanimous verdicts. (AP)

The Montgomery County state’s attorney, John McCarthy, said that Mr. Tordil glasses were knocked off in a struggle with one of his victims on Friday, and that he may have stayed in the area because he could not see to drive.
