Whether pharaohs’ tombs or Warhol’s paintings, food shows up frequently in art. Now Judith Walsh, who runs Art Smart museum tours, is offering a food-themed tour at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. And after the visit, participants can choose a meal that reflects the work. The meals are served either at the Aldo Sohm Wine Bar, 151 West 51st Street, where the food is paired with wine and beer, $120 for two ($60 a person for larger groups), or at Amali, 115 East 60th Street, where a six-course dinner for four to 20 guests is $100 a person, with wine extra: Feast Your Eyes Tours, $175 an hour for up to five people, in addition to dining costs, 212-595-4444, artsmart.com.
