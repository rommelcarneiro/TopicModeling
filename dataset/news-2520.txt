Jaap van Zweden, the Dutch conductor, still stands to earn plenty of frequent-flier miles after he becomes the music director of the New York Philharmonic in 2018. He has extended his contract for his other job, some 8,000 miles away, as the music director of the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra through the 2021-22 season, the orchestra announced Thursday.

Mr. van Zweden — who has been conducting Wagner’s “Ring” cycle with the Hong Kong Philharmonic in annual installments starring Matthias Goerne as Wotan — said in a statement that he considered every player there “a gem” and that he looked forward to extending his tenure.

“We have many more exciting projects yet to come,” he said. Next season he is scheduled to lead the orchestra in nine concert programs, including Wagner’s “Siegfried” and symphonies by Mahler, Shostakovich and Schubert.

Michael MacLeod, chief executive of the Hong Kong Philharmonic, said in a statement that the orchestra was “honored to share the same conductor with the New York Philharmonic.”

Mr. van Zweden is currently the music director of the Dallas Symphony Orchestra. While his contract there was originally to have ended in 2019 — the same year his Hong Kong contract was to end — the orchestra agreed to release him after the 2017-18 season so he could take the New York post.

Moonlighting is not uncommon in the orchestra world. When Yannick Nézet-Séguin announced last week that he would become the next music director of the Metropolitan Opera starting in the 2020-21 season, he simultaneously announced that he was extending his contract as music director of the Philadelphia Orchestra through the 2025-26 season.
