Did the Big Bang blow bubbles?

A look at this glistening blue blob floating through the cosmos could give that impression. But what looks like a celestial mix of soap and water is actually something much dirtier: a colossal cloud of dust and gas.

An image, taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, shows the aptly named Bubble Nebula, which is some 8,000 light-years away. Astronomers at NASA and the European Space Agency released the photo on Thursday to celebrate the 26th anniversary of the telescope’s launch, which is Sunday.

Last year, Dennis Overbye wrote about why it’s quite astounding that Hubble ever reached its twenties at all.

This isn’t the first time researchers have photographed the nebula. However, previous images could only capture bits of its bubbly bulk. It stretches more than 10 light-years across, and it is constantly growing. Its star, SAO 20575, spews stellar winds that inflate the cloud as it travels at a rate of 62,000 miles per hour.

For Hubble’s birthday picture, the researchers used an updated camera to snap four separate images that they later stitched together. The final image provides a clear view of the entire dirty bubble.
