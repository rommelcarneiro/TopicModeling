A police commander who was stripped of his gun and badge in April amid an extensive federal inquiry into municipal corruption has filed for retirement, his lawyer and the New York Police Department said on Tuesday.

The commander, Deputy Inspector James Grant, filed his retirement papers on Monday, his lawyer, John C. Meringolo, said. Inspector Grant, the commander of the 19th Precinct on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, was among several police officials disciplined last month in connection with the investigation. The inquiry is focused on the conduct of two businessmen with ties to Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, and their efforts to wield influence with police officials and others in the mayor’s administration.

Mr. Meringolo said investigators had questioned his client at home, but he declined to provide additional details.

“Any questions that he’s been asked, he’s answered truthfully,” Mr. Meringolo said. “We anticipate him retiring now and moving on with the next step of his life.”

The Police Department has 30 days to consider Inspector Grant’s notice, during which the police commissioner, William J. Bratton, could decide to bring departmental charges against him. Stephen P. Davis, the top police spokesman, confirmed that Inspector Grant had notified the department of his retirement. Mr. Davis declined to comment further because of the continuing investigation, which is also led by the Internal Affairs Bureau.

Inspector Grant’s retirement would take effect in June, about a month before he completes 20 years of service, a move that could significantly impact his pension, Mr. Meringolo said.
