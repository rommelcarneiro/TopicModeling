“An architecture of desire” is what Heather Kravas calls the duets among six women divided into three couples in her piece “play, thing.” But before this convergence takes place, they’ll evoke states of fear, anxiety, playfulness, power and eroticism through symmetrical floor patterns, rhythmic shifts, and precise and repetitive dance steps. And these movements, based on quotidian activities, will be combined with simple words.

Ms. Kravas, who comes from Seattle, says her works “grapple with inevitable disorder,” and has expressed a desire “to reflect something vital about the brutal and beautiful condition of being alive.” It seems likely that the rigorously structured “play, thing” will be something more than fun and games.
