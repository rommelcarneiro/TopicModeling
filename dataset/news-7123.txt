An off-duty New York City correction officer was arrested over the weekend after she pulled out a loaded gun during an argument over a parking spot in Manhattan, the police said.

The officer, Robin Mervin, was arrested on charges of menacing and criminal possession of a weapon after the confrontation late on Saturday, the police said.

Officer Mervin, 29, blocked a driver from parking on a Harlem street and then drew a weapon out of a holster and pointed it at the driver, the police said. At that point, the police said, the driver involved in the confrontation with Officer Mervin called 911.

It was not clear whether the gun was Officer Mervinâ€™s service weapon. A spokeswoman for the Correction Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the arrest.

It was not clear if Officer Mervin had a lawyer.
