For his bookshop and website One Grand Books, the editor Aaron Hicklin asked people to name the 10 books they’d take with them if they were marooned on a desert island. The next in the series is the singer Eleanor Friedberger, whose latest album, “New View,” is out now. She shares her list exclusively with T.

“World Within World,” Stephen Spender

For those thinking about writing a memoir, take a lesson from Mr. Spender and read this!

“The House Book (1974 edition),” Terence Conran

The bible for home interior design and a little soft porn to boot.

“The Sea, The Sea,” Iris Murdoch

Murdoch’s beautiful writing is endlessly entertaining and this novel about obsession is a perfect read while traveling alone.

“Jerusalem: A Cookbook,” Yotam Ottolenghi

My go-to cookbook where you can’t go wrong.

“Women Poets of Japan,” edited by Kenneth Rexroth & Ikuko Atsumi

For when you’re feeling moody or need a quick line to woo someone with.

“A Life in Movies: An Autobiography,” Michael Powell

A true master; take your time reading this in between watching “A Matter of Life and Death,” “The Red Shoes” and “I Know Where I’m Going.”

“The Greek Islands,” Lawrence Durrell

A memoir, travel, history and photo book rolled into one; Durrell is a perfect companion.

“Popism, The Warhol ’60s,” Andy Warhol & Pat Hackett

Totally hilarious and a great sneak peek into ’60s New York.

“The Songs of Bob Dylan from 1966 through 1977,” Bob Dylan

Grab a guitar and play some songs!

“Division Street: America,” Studs Terkel

Particular affinity to this since I grew up one block north of Division Street; the greatest listener shares the voices of the people of Chicago.
