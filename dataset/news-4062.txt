Not so long ago, Donald J. Trump singled out Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets, as he criticized Jeb Bush for taking “special interest” donor money in the Republican presidential campaign.

That was before the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 9. Now, Mr. Johnson is one of the six finance vice chairmen at the Republican National Committee, seeking to help Mr. Trump raise roughly $1 billion over the next six months.

“He’s going to be the nominee of the party,” Mr. Johnson said in an interview in his Midtown Manhattan office on Thursday. “I’ve always supported the party, I think it’s important that we do have unity. Maybe not the kind of unity we all understand, but we’ll have some sort of unity.”

Mr. Johnson said that Mr. Trump sought his help during a meeting on Monday at Trump Tower. They did not discuss Mr. Trump’s criticism of Mr. Johnson as a major donor during the primaries, Mr. Johnson said.

“It doesn’t bother me,” Mr. Johnson said. “I’ve been in sports a long time. In sports, we’re in the ‘win’ business and we want to entertain our fans.”

The money needed to be raised is a lot, but not prohibitive, Mr. Johnson said, although he has not begun to make calls. Mr. Trump’s children will be deployed as fund-raising surrogates, Mr. Johnson said, but he anticipates the candidate’s time will be used “judiciously.”

Mr. Johnson has known Mr. Trump for roughly 30 years. Their daughters were friends in school, and they have known each other socially. Mr. Johnson said that Mr. Trump had taken part in a charity he had hosted over the years, and that people did not have a sense of the real person. And that is the man he will sell to donors.

“I think they confuse his persona with the kind of person he actually is,” Mr. Johnson said. “You have to see him through his kids, in a way, and his wife.”
