Many years ago, I walked into the F. Rozzo & Sons storefront on Ninth Avenue because chefs like André Soltner of Lutèce had lauded the quality of the fish. There was not a fish in sight, and I was told it was wholesale only. That policy has changed. Under the direction of Louis Rozzo, whose Neapolitan grandfather started the company in 1900 and bought the building in 1905, F. Rozzo & Sons occasionally accommodated a retail customer. But now they have started selling a limited array of seafood across the country. They are working with FoodyDirect in Menlo Park, Calif., an online resource that ships food from a long list of purveyors. I ordered wild king salmon and cod, and like most of the choices, they were available only as four seven-ounce fillets. They were shipped overnight and came to my doorstep on time, excellently fresh: F. Rozzo & Sons at foodydirect.com.
