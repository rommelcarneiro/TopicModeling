Several months ago, on a whim, Rachelle Hruska MacPherson, the co-founder and C.E.O. of Guestofaguest.com, stitched the word “Booyah” onto a cashmere sweater. The letters were crude and lopsided, but she liked the way they looked. Before long, her Instagram posts of other sweaters, with phrases like “Outlaw” and “Where’s the Outrage,” were sparking high demand. At first she obliged only a few people — “Original Gangsta” for Christy Turlington; “Fight the Power” for Mark Ruffalo — but now they’re on sale, for $360 each, at the Crow’s Nest Inn in Montauk (owned by her husband, the hotelier Sean MacPherson) and at the Upper East Side boutique Five Story.
