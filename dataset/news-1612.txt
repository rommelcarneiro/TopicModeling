Revlon said on Thursday it was buying Elizabeth Arden for $419.3 million in cash, a deal uniting two well-known names in cosmetics.

The companies value the deal at $870 million, including debt. Revlon is paying $14 for each Elizabeth Arden share, a premium of 50 percent over the closing price on Thursday.

Revlon said the combined company would benefit from having a presence in more markets worldwide. It estimated savings of $140 million from the combination.

Elizabeth Arden opened her first Red Door salon on Fifth Avenue in 1910. The company, now based in Miramar, Fla., sells skin care products and fragrances in 120 countries. It has been trying to turn its fortunes around, posting a loss of $28.4 million on revenue of $191.9 million in its most recent quarter.

Revlon was founded in 1932 with the release of its nail enamel. This year, it posted a first-quarter profit of $11 million on sales of $439.6 million.

It has a new chief executive, Fabian Garcia, who came from Colgate-Palmolive in April.

E. Scott Beattie, Elizabeth Ardenâ€™s chairman, president and chief executive, will join the Revlon board as nonexecutive vice chairman. He will be senior adviser to Mr. Garcia.

The companies predicted the deal would close this year.

Elizabeth Arden shares jumped $4.67, or 50 percent, to $13.98 in after-hours trading after the deal was announced. Revlon gained 15 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $31.30.
