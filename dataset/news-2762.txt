Two widely followed benchmarks ended higher on Tuesday, as energy shares rebounded and investor confidence rose on news that an increase in interest rates was not imminent.

The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index gained just 2.72 points, or 0.13 percent, to 2,112.13, but that was its highest close since July 2015. The index is now nearly 19 points shy of its closing high of 2,130.82.

The Dow Jones industrial average ended up 17.95 points, or 0.1 percent, at 17,938.28, after exceeding 18,000.

The Nasdaq composite index ended lower, however. Biotech shares dropped after disappointing news from several major companies, including Biogen. The Nasdaq dipped 6.96 points, or 0.14 percent, to 4,961.75. The Nasdaq biotech index was down 2.5 percent.

The S.&P. energy index jumped 2.1 percent as oil prices reached 2016 highs because of supply constraints and a weak dollar. Exxon Mobil gained 1.5 percent to $90.71.

Crude oil settled up 67 cents, or 1.35 percent, at $50.36 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude settled up 89 cents, or 1.76 percent, at $51.44 a barrel.

“With the industry projecting a decline in total U.S. crude oil stocks in this week’s reports, the market bears are remaining on the sidelines,” said Dominick Chirichella, senior partner at the Energy Management Institute in New York.

Worries over potential supply shortages from attacks on Nigeria’s oil industry helped raise oil prices, as did expectations of a probable decline in American crude stocks, the third in three weeks.

The price of oil has nearly doubled since January, helped largely by unplanned failures that have eroded production in Canada, Venezuela, Libya and Nigeria, along with a steady decline in higher-cost shale output in the United States.

Comments by Janet L. Yellen, chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, on Monday also seemed to ease some worries about the economy, while underscoring the view that the Fed may be in no rush to raise rates.

“The big story for the market right now is, Do we break out to all-time highs?” said Michael Sheldon, chief investment officer at Northstar Wealth Partners in West Hartford, Conn.

“If we do so in the near term, we could see a rush of money jump into the market from investors who had been sitting out on the sidelines, in fear of missing out on further market gains.”

Biogen tumbled 12.8 percent to $252.86 after its multiple sclerosis drug failed in a midstage study.

Alexion dropped 10.9 percent to $138.13 after its drug failed a trial, while the drug company Valeant slumped 14.6 percent to $24.64 after cutting its full-year forecast.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.72 percent, from 1.74 percent late on Monday.
