Stocks in the United States and global markets fell for a fourth day on Tuesday as investors awaited the Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rates and continued to worry about Britain’s expected close vote on whether to leave the European Union.

Credit card company stocks fell sharply after Synchrony Financial, the country’s leading issuer of store brand credit cards, warned that more of its customers were falling behind on payments.

The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 3.74 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,075.32, and the Nasdaq composite fell 4.89 points, or 0.1 percent, to 4,843.55.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 57.66 points, or 0.3 percent, to 17,674.82.

United States government bond yields remained at their lowest levels since 2012 as investors sought safety ahead of the Fed meeting and the vote in Britain. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was 1.61 percent, up slightly from a day earlier.

In Europe, benchmark German government bond yields fell below zero percent for the first time, a signal that skittish investors are willing to pay to park their money in investments they consider supersafe.

The Federal Reserve’s two-day meeting started on Tuesday, with a decision on interest rates to be announced on Wednesday. The Fed had been expected to raise interest rates, but after some weak economic data, including the most recent monthly jobs report, it now appears likely to wait.

Most investors are focused overseas right now. There is considerable uncertainty about whether British voters will choose to leave the European Union in a referendum on June 23. Polls show the vote could go either way, and investors are starting to worry about the consequences.

A British exit from the European Union, known informally as Brexit, would probably hurt the British economy most and destabilize the rest of Europe. The repercussions, however, are not clear.

“Investors are Brexit-proofing their portfolios right now,” said Anastasia Amoroso, a global markets strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.

In individual companies, Synchrony Financial plunged $3.99, or 13 percent, to $26.45 after the company disclosed that more of its customers were falling behind on payments. The company is also taking losses on more accounts than anticipated.

In commodities, benchmark crude dropped 39 cents, to $48.49 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, used to price international oils, fell 52 cents, to $49.83 per barrel in London.

Gold rose $1.20, to $1,285.60 an ounce; silver fell 2 cents, to $17.42 an ounce; and copper fell 1 cent, to $2.04 a pound.

The dollar fell to 106.12 yen from 106.17 yen. The euro edged down to $1.1204 from $1.1294.
