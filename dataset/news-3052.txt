As usual, the economists miss the political forest for the economic trees. What the T.S.A. screens for is a political decision, and the budget they are provided is a political decision. The simplest solution to long lines: Hire more T.S.A. inspectors.

Mr. Mullainathan and Mr. Thaler state: “We have no way of knowing whether the current procedures are optimal.” But we do. The T.S.A. regularly conducts screening tests, attempting to bring contraband through checkpoints. Reportedly, in 95 percent of the tests, T.S.A. checkpoint agents fail to detect prohibited items brought in by other T.S.A. agents.

The traveling public deserves a less expensive, more efficient process. What are we waiting for?

The crowds that are created by the T.S.A. are perfect launching platforms for suicide bombers. Why should they wait to get to the screeners?

Let’s take a look at the “costs” in the system imposed by the airlines’ continuation of baggage fees, which is the unnamed culprit here. The T.S.A. could cut its budget and shave off plenty of wait time if passengers weren’t hauling all their luggage to avoid outrageous baggage fees while cargo holds go empty.
