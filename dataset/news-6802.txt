Sight Unseen Offsite, the show produced by the former ID magazine editors Monica Khemsurov (at left) and Jill Singer (right), may attract only a fraction of the visitors expected at the International Contemporary Furniture Fair, but those who know design consider it a must-see for new talent. David Alhadeff, owner of the Future Perfect, said it is “more of interest to me — not only as a cultural participant of design week, but also as a buyer within design week — than any other off-site or the Javits.”

An offshoot of the online magazine the pair founded in 2009, the show will be in the Grace Building overlooking Bryant Park this year, with more than 50 exhibitors. And it has become such a part of the establishment that Mr. Alhadeff joked about using the name as an adjective. “I sometimes refer to things as being ‘so Sight Unseen,’” he said. “It’s not a negative comment.”
