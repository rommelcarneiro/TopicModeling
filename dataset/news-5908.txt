Late last year, in what seemed a David-and-Goliath case for the concert industry, a ticketing start-up filed a federal antitrust lawsuit against Ticketmaster, saying it was abusing its market power over the lucrative niche of ticket sales for musicians’ fan clubs.

The case, filed in December by Songkick, provided a glimpse into the highly competitive world of “artist presale” tickets, which has become a point of contention as touring musicians seek to maximize their earning potential.

But on Wednesday, a judge denied the injunction and largely sided with Ticketmaster, which argued that its contracts with concert halls allow it to determine how tickets are allotted.

Ticketmaster allows artists to sell a portion — typically 8 to 10 percent — of the tickets to their concerts through fan clubs, and competes with Songkick and other companies to handle those sales. But Ticketmaster also argues that its contracts allow it to determine what is a legitimate fan club; a number of such cases are in dispute in the Songkick suit.

In March, Songkick asked the judge for a temporary injunction against Ticketmaster, saying that the company had been “retaliating” against Songkick’s clients. When Songkick handled a presale, it said, Ticketmaster demanded that it pay the fees that Ticketmaster would otherwise have made from selling those tickets. Those actions, Songkick argued, would “drive Songkick out of the artist presale ticketing business in the U.S.”

Judge Dale S. Fischer of United States District Court in Los Angeles rejected Songkick’s request, saying that the company’s argument “failed to show virtually any likelihood of success on its merits.”

The case may still go to trial, but the judge’s decision suggests that Songkick has so far failed to make a persuasive antitrust argument.

“While the exclusive contracts are at issue in the lawsuit,” the judge wrote, “the current motion makes no serious attempt to demonstrate that these contracts, in and of themselves, violate antitrust law.”

Ticketmaster, a division of Live Nation Entertainment, is by far the giant of the ticketing world, selling $25 billion worth of tickets last year, according to company filings.

Last week, Ticketmaster filed a countersuit, saying Songkick was interfering in its business. Ticketmaster argues that it wins exclusive rights to sell tickets for concert venues by bidding against competitors, and that those contracts give it control over how tickets are sold, including through presales handled by other vendors.

In a statement, Jared Smith, the president of Ticketmaster North America, said that the ruling “confirms that Ticketmaster’s exclusive rights agreements mean what they say, and that Ticketmaster is entitled to protect itself from third-party ticketing companies exploiting our voluntary program for artist fan club presales.”

Songkick said it was disappointed by the ruling but was still pursuing its remaining claims in the suit, which include conspiracy and unfair competition.

“Songkick will continue with its legal case and remains committed to providing artists with an alternative that puts tickets in the hands of fans at a lower cost and helps keep them out of the hands of scalpers,” the company said in a statement.

In a separate order, the judge dismissed a claim in Songkick’s lawsuit that had challenged Ticketmaster’s merger with Live Nation, completed in 2010, on antitrust grounds.
