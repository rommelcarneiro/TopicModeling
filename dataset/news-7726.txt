The creative process can be as alluring as the final product — perhaps even more so. And, thanks in no small part to the standard set by Google headquarters, the work spaces carved out by creative types are becoming ever more imaginative, and are as inspiring as they are inspired.

In Dublin, the lifestyle brand ROADS has at its core a belief in the power of surrounding yourself with artistic, thoughtfully crafted (and curated) objects — as evidenced by its products, which include books and fragrances. (Its minimally packaged and imaginatively named candles and perfumes — one scent is called I Am Dance; another, Moon Garden — are recently available at Barneys.) And the newest book from ROADS’s publishing imprint, “The Creative Workplace” ($40, available nationwide next month), brings us into some of the most thoughtfully designed and appointed creative agencies and design studios around the world. Above is a sneak peek of some of its pages.
