“Guards at the Taj,’’ Rajiv Joseph’s bloodstained drama about humble sentries in 17th-century India, won the Obie Award for best new American play at a ceremony celebrating the best of Off Broadway on Monday night. Omar Metwally and Arian Moayed, the actors in the Atlantic Theater Company production, were singled out for their performances as well.

Among the other award winners: playwrights Lucas Hnath, hailed for “The Christians” and “Red Speedo,” and Stephen Karam, whose family drama, “The Humans” has since transferred to Broadway, where it is up for a Tony Award as best play.

An award for musical theater went to the composers Benj Pasek and Justin Paul and the book writer Steven Levenson for “Dear Evan Hansen,” now playing at Second Stage Theater. The show’s 23-year-old star, Ben Platt, won an Obie for his performance as an anxious high schooler caught up in a lie; other new faces singled out included Khris Davis, who played a boxer in Lincoln Center Theater’s “The Royale,” as well as the veterans Georgia Engel (for “John” at the Signature Theater Company) and Tamara Tunie (for “Familiar” at Playwrights Horizons.)

The ensemble of “Eclipsed,” now on Broadway after a run at the Public Theater, shared an acting prize as well.

The Obies gave out special citations for the collaborators on “John,” including the playwright Annie Baker, the director Sam Gold and the show’s design team. The playwright Dominique Morisseau and the director Ruben Santiago-Hudson received a citation as well for their work on “Skeleton Crew,” which just reopened at the Atlantic Theater Company.

The American Theater Wing and the Village Voice sponsor the Obies, which are decided by a group of journalists and theater professionals. There are no set categories. This year Obies for lifetime achievement went to the playwright A. R. Gurney and the actor-dancer-choreographer Carmen de Lavallade.
