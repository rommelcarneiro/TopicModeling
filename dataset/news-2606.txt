The tragedies of Julius Caesar and Malcolm X will unfold onstage next season at the New Victory Theater, in “Caesar/X” — Shakespeare’s “Julius Caesar” and “X,” a new play by Marcus Gardley, being shown in conversation with each other.

Staged by the Acting Company, the plays run March 17 through March 26 and are among more than a dozen productions planned for New Victory’s 2016-17 season, which includes seven additional premieres.

Other shows include “Aging Magician,” (March 3 through March 12), an interdisciplinary opera-like work that combines music, puppetry and theater that had its premiere at Walker Art Center in March and was performed in the workshop stage at the Prototype Festival last year.

Akram Khan Company, an Indian-inspired dance troupe, presents its first work of family-friendly dance theater, “Chotto Desh,” Nov. 4 through Nov. 13. Among other family performances is the debut of the musical “Elephant & Piggie’s We Are in a Play!” (Jan. 28 through Feb. 5), based on the Elephant & Piggie children’s books by Mo Willems.

The season’s lineup is at newvictory.org.
