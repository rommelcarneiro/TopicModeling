LONDON — Britain’s legendary weather has been captured in a quirky 37-piece jewelry collection that includes a shining sun, flashing bolts of lightning and thunderous clouds.

“I thought it would be more fun to wear the weather than talk about it,” said Tessa Packard, the designer. The collection, Every Cloud Has a Silver Lining, debuted on her website in April with prices ranging from 30 pounds, or $43, for a gold bolt charm to £6,900 for a diamond cloud with diamond and sapphire raindrops.

In addition to necklaces, earrings and even cufflinks, rings evoke familiar weather conditions, too. There are frosty white or black-ice diamonds and rainbow bands with emeralds glittering alongside pink, orange, red, yellow and blue sapphires. “I picked gems that would stack together, which would not look boring nor too vivid,” she said, “so there was a lot of trial and error playing around.”

Ms. Packard’s hand-sketched designs may look simple but they challenged the veteran goldsmiths in London and Birmingham who executed the pieces. Stephen Brady of the Birmingham firm Deakin & Francis, who worked on the mother of pearl clouds, said: “We usually work with circles or squares, but these cloud shapes are all angles and curves, so it was much more difficult to fit into the gold edging and make sure there was no gaps.”
