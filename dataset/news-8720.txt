After a three-day search, the police on Monday arrested a 53-year-old man who is suspected of fatally stabbing a fellow resident at a Manhattan homeless shelter and then slashing a cabdriver in the neck the next day.

Investigators found the man, William Smith, who has an arrest history stretching back to the 1980s, on the street in Astoria, Queens, around 11 a.m., the police said. Charges were pending.

The killing on Friday, at the 30th Street Men’s Shelter in Kips Bay, reignited concerns about violence in New York City’s overcrowded shelter system, the site of a string of deadly attacks this year. The police said Mr. Smith stabbed Marcus Guerreiro, a 56-year-old shelter resident, in the right side of his neck and choked him with a wire.

Other residents saw Mr. Smith washing blood off his hands.

On Saturday around 12:30 a.m., Mr. Smith hailed a cab in Queens and asked to be taken to a Holiday Inn in the Corona neighborhood, the police said. When the cab arrived, Mr. Smith pulled out a sharp object, demanded money and, after the driver refused, slashed him in the neck before running away. Mr. Smith left behind a cellphone and wallet with his ID.

The attack fit a recurring pattern, the police said. Around 2 p.m. on April 11, Mr. Smith got into a taxi by a Brooklyn hotel and asked to go to Queens. He exited the car without paying, and came back 15 minutes later with a sharp object.

“Give me all your money,” he said, according to the police. He ran off with $225.

Mr. Smith served time in state prison in 2014 on a burglary conviction.
