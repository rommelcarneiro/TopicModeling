It has been 365 days since Donald J. Trump lit the 2016 presidential race on fire.

On June 16, 2015, Mr. Trump stood in the pink-marbled lower lobby of Trump Tower, tossed out his planned remarks to deliver a diatribe against President Obama and the nations he believes are lifting unfairly from the United States, and promised to build a wall along the border with Mexico to keep out “rapists” and those bringing in “crime.”

As The New York Times wrote of the kickoff: “If Mr. Trump’s ideology has proved flexible, the cornerstone of his worldview has not: He has consistently been a passionate believer in Donald Trump, and his own capacity to bully and badger his way into the best possible deal. That skill set, Mr. Trump has argued, would be an asset to America.”

In the intervening year, Mr. Trump has made a mockery of the Republican establishment that sought to stop him and the pundits who guffawed at his prospects. He vanquished 16 candidates using a nativist appeal with a strong emphasis on ending trade deals, deporting 11 million immigrants and ending the George W. Bush-era approach to foreign policy.

Yet Mr. Trump has refused to evolve from the candidate whose position rose on his rallies, his debate performances and his expert ability to mock a rival’s weak points. Instead of curtailing his language from the primary, he has doubled down. He has picked fights with Republican leaders trying to get behind his candidacy. And he has warned that the party needs him more than he needs it.

Republican leaders do not share that supposition. In the month before the party’s convention, Mr. Trump has bounced from one incendiary statement to the next. Republican foreign policy leaders have compared him to European fascists. And his poll numbers have fallen sharply.

A year ago, Mr. Trump may have set fire to what was predicted to be a sleepy national race. But over the many days since, it is his chances at the presidency that he has risked dousing in flames.
