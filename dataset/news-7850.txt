At a new seasonal store in SoHo, you can embellish your own ice cream pop, dipped in your choice of chocolate, then top it with any three of 20 ingredients like chopped nuts, rose petals, mint chips and sea salt, and finish it with another drizzle of chocolate. Magnum Ice Cream has been rolling out custom-dipping shops around the world, but this is the first in the United States. Unilever, which owns Magnum, is the world’s largest ice cream company, owning brands like Ben & Jerry’s, Fudgsicle and Klondike. Last year in the United States alone, it sold more than 100 million prepackaged Magnum ice cream bars on a stick. The ice cream is made with milk with no added hormones, and the chocolate is Barry Callebaut from Belgium: Custom ice cream bar, $7, at Magnum New York until mid-August, 134 Prince Street (Wooster Street), 646-395-7463, facebook.com/magnum.
