LONDON — Philips, the Dutch electronics giant, said on Monday that the initial public offering of its lighting business this month could value the business at up to 4.92 billion euros, or about $5.6 billion, including debt.

Philips said this month that it planned to list the lighting business in an offering on the Euronext stock exchange in Amsterdam. The company first announced plans in 2014 to spin off the lighting business as part of a reshaping of the company to focus on health care and technology.

“Today’s announcement is an important next step in the planned initial public offering of Philips Lighting,” Frans van Houten, the Philips chief executive, said in a news release.

The Dutch company said that it expected to price the offering of its lighting business in a range of €18.50 to €22.50 a share.

That would give the company a market capitalization of €3.38 billion at the top end of the range and a value of €4.92 billion, including debt and pension obligations.

The offering to institutional investors, as well as retail investors in the Netherlands, would consist of 37.5 million shares, or about 25 percent of Philips Lighting’s shares. If an overallotment of shares is fully exercised, Phillips could receive up to €970 million in proceeds from the sale.

Shares of the lighting business are expected to begin conditional trading in Amsterdam on May 27.

Philips would retain a majority of the company’s shares, with a plan to fully sell down its ownership over the next several years.

The lighting business includes divisions that produce traditional light bulbs and LED lamps and that design complete lighting systems. The business had about 34,000 employees and posted sales of €7.5 billion in 2015.

In April, Philips said that it was “actively engaging” with interested parties about the separate sale of its automotive and LED components business, Lumileds.

In January, Philips called off the sale of a controlling stake in the Lumileds business to GO Scale Capital, an investment fund sponsored by GSR Ventures of China and Oak Investment Partners, because of regulatory concerns raised in the United States.

Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase are acting as global co-coordinators on the offering.
