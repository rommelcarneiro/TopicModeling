Good evening. Here’s the latest.

1. “You win the pennant and now you’re in the World Series — you gonna change?” That was Donald Trump, on the eve of meetings with Paul Ryan and other congressional Republicans. He seemed to be defying expectations that, with the presidential nomination all but won, he would soften his message and focus on unifying his party.

_____

2. Bernie Sanders, bolstered by his decisive primary victory in West Virginia, reminded voters that he outpolls Hillary Clinton in hypothetical face-offs with Donald Trump. Mrs. Clinton focused on Mr. Trump’s tax returns, sidestepping his attacks on her as an enabler of her husband’s extramarital behavior. “You’ve got to ask yourself, why doesn’t he want to release them?” she said. “Yeah, well, we’re going to find out.”

_____

3. A series of bombings struck three areas of Baghdad, killing more than 90 people and recalling Iraq’s years of sectarian and civil war. The Islamic State claimed the deadliest attack, in which a produce truck parked at a crowded food market exploded.

_____

4. The power struggle in Brazil moved into an all-day, possibly all-night session in the Senate, as lawmakers debated whether to suspend and try President Dilma Rousseff. She is accused of manipulating the budget to hide the depths of Brazil’s economic troubles. Above, guards at the presidential offices.

5. A scientist says the two-hour mark for the marathon could be broken by the end of 2019. Yannis Pitsiladis, testing a runner’s lung capacity above, is raising funds and recruiting help to find new approaches in nutrition, biomechanics and related fields. “We know nothing about the science of training,” he said. “I really mean nothing. When I say that, people get really upset.”

_____

6. Three years ago, Texas suffered one of its worst industrial disasters when a fertilizer plant north of Waco exploded, killing 15 people, injuring more than 260 and wrecking hundreds of homes. Federal investigators finally announced a cause — arson — and offered a reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to an arrest.

_____

7. Frank talk captured in an official video of Queen Elizabeth II’s garden party caused diplomatic stirs. In one part, the queen observes that members of the Chinese president’s entourage had been “very rude” to a British diplomat during his visit last fall. In another section, Prime Minister David Cameron calls Afghanistan and Nigeria “fantastically corrupt.”

_____

8. Michael Slager, the former South Carolina police officer charged with murder in the death of a black motorist, now also faces federal civil rights charges. Mr. Slager had said he needed to defend himself, but a video showed the victim, Walter Scott, running after a brief scuffle and being shot repeatedly. Separately, the F.B.I. director, James Comey, cited a “viral video effect” on police officers that he said might help explain rising urban homicide rates.

_____

9. A Colorado judge ruled Robert Dear incompetent to stand trial on charges of killing three people and injuring nine in a shooting spree at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs last year. The decision means he will be sent to a state mental hospital.

_____

10. More than a million residents of Texas now have active handgun licenses. That is more than many other states, but at least one has more: Florida, with more than 1.7 million. And the per capita count puts Florida, Tennessee and Washington State far ahead of Texas.

_____

11. Finally, one of our best-read stories today is an essay by two experts in non-Western philosophy. They urge U.S. universities to either use the name “Department of European and American Philosophy” or, better, to include Asian, African, Native American and other thinkers. They quote the Stoics: “The Fates lead those who come willingly, and drag those who do not.”
