And lo, it came to pass that the one they called Barbra would go on a summer tour and then release a new album. And the tour would include two nights in Brooklyn. And her many fans rejoiced.

Of course they will, right?

On Monday, Barbra Streisand’s longtime manager, Marty Erlichman, announced that Ms. Streisand’s latest North American tour would begin on Aug. 2, at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, and continue through Aug. 23, at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto.

The tour will also go to Las Vegas, Chicago, Boston, Washington, Philadelphia and San Jose, Calif., and on Aug. 11 and 13 it will come to Barclays Center in Brooklyn, where Ms. Streisand, 74, was one of the arena’s opening attractions in October 2012.

Tickets will go on sale on May 25, although tickets will be available to American Express customers early, starting Wednesday.

According to the announcement, online ticket buyers will receive a copy of Ms. Streisand’s latest album, “Encore: Movie Partners Sing Broadway,” a duets record to be released “later this year.” Neither the exact release date nor the names of any of the partners was announced.

Ms. Streisand’s last album, “Partners,” opened at No. 1 on the Billboard chart in 2014, giving her the distinction of being the only act to reach No. 1 on the chart in each of the last six decades, starting in 1964, when “People,” her fourth album, made it to the top.
