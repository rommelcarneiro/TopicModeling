As part of T’s ongoing series, the artist Christian Marclay, best known for his film montage “The Clock,” responded to a poem by Billy Collins, a former poet laureate of the United States.

GREECE

The ruins were taking their time falling apart, the stones that once held up other stones now scattered on top of one another

as if many centuries had to pass before they harkened to the call of gravity.

And the few pillars still upright had nervous looks on their faces teetering there in the famous sunlight which descended on the grass and the disheveled stones.

Which is precisely how the bathers appeared after we had changed at the cliff-side hotel and made our way down to the rocky beach —

pillars of flesh in bathing suits, two pillars tossing a colorful ball, one pillar lying with his arm around another,

even a tiny pillar with a pail and shovel, all deaf to a voice as old as the surf itself.

Is not poetry a megaphone held up to the whispering lips of death? I wrote, before capping my pen and charging into the waves with a shout.

— BILLY COLLINS
