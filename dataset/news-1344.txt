Hillary Clinton, who often talks on the campaign trail about being a grandmother, now has twice the reason for doing so as her daughter Chelsea Clinton has given birth to her second child.

Ms. Clinton announced the birth of a boy on Twitter Saturday.

“We are overjoyed to be grandparents again,” said a statement from Hillary and Bill Clinton. “Chelsea and Aidan are both doing well and enjoying this very special time together.”

The birth makes a big sister out of Chelsea Clinton’s and her husband Marc Mezvinsky’s first child, Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky, who was born on Sept. 26, 2014.

Mrs. Clinton, set to become the first female presidential nominee of a major party, often talks about motherhood and grandmotherhood as part of her appeal to women.

Her Republican opponent, Donald J. Trump, also welcomed a new grandchild this year — his eighth.

Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, gave birth to a boy, Theodore James Kushner, in March. It was the couple’s third child.

Donald J. Trump Jr. and his wife, Vanessa, have five children.
