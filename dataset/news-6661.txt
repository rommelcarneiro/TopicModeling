FX is adding another Ryan Murphy anthology series to its lineup.

“Feud,” which will dramatize famous clashes, is the third limited anthology show Mr. Murphy will have done for the network, joining the macabre “American Horror Story” and “American Crime Story,” a hit earlier this year with its first installment, “The People v. O.J. Simpson.”

Debuting in 2017, the eight-episode first edition of “Feud” will explore the longstanding rivalry between the mercurial film stars Joan Crawford and Bette Davis, who came together for the 1962 film “What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?” in an effort to rejuvenate their careers. “Feud” will unfold largely on the set of the film, a garish psychodrama that went on to critical and box office success, and an enduring reputation as a camp classic.

Jessica Lange, a former fixture on “American Horror Story,” will star as Ms. Crawford, and Susan Sarandon will play Ms. Davis. The cast will also include Alfred Molina as Robert Aldrich, the film’s director, and Stanley Tucci as the studio boss Jack Warner. The pilot is based in part on a script by Jaffe Cohen and Michael Zam.

Mr. Murphy will be an executive producer, along with Brad Pitt and Dede Gardner.

“American Horror Story,” which changes spooky settings each year but recycles much of its cast, has been a ratings winner for FX since it debuted in 2011. “The People v. O.J. Simpson” was arguably the most acclaimed new show of 2016. The next “American Crime Story” reportedly will dramatize the events surrounding Hurricane Katrina.
