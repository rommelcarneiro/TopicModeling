Whiling away a few hours on a summer Sunday walk with ice cream in hand is the agenda at Sugartooth Tours. The tour stops at several ice cream shops as it meanders through Little Italy, SoHo and Chinatown. The company also has cupcake rambles and other dessert-oriented walking tours. Each takes about two and a half hours: $50, plus $3 fee (ice cream included), Sugartooth Tours, sugartoothtours.com.
