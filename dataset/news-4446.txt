OKLAHOMA CITY — Late in the morning, before the N.B.A. would rule him eligible for Game 4 of the Western Conference finals Tuesday night, Draymond Green sat on a courtside table inside Chesapeake Energy Arena and argued that the human brain has control over the arm, but not necessarily the leg.

The lower appendage, according to Green, has a mind of its own.

Contrasting his right leg’s rendezvous Sunday night with the Oklahoma City center Steven Adams’s groin with the forearm smash that the Cleveland Cavaliers reserve Dahntay Jones administered the Toronto Raptors’ Bismack Biyombo in the same private area, Green said: “If I come punch you in your head, I’m going to intentionally use my arm. I don’t think you can ever compare a leg to an arm.”

Ever? That would suggest that every kickoff and field goal in N.F.L. history and most soccer goals have been accidents, or mere reflex actions.

But Green, the Golden State Warriors’ undersize power forward, admitted there was another explanation that should also have exonerated him on the always thorny charge of intent. His second-quarter Rockette performance was a theatrical ploy designed to sell contact and a foul, the painful (for Adams) result being an unintended consequence.

On that front, it was, in part, Russell Westbrook’s fault.

“Russell said I did it on purpose, but he’s part of the superstar group that started all this acting,” Green said.

He had a reasonable point there, and only there. At the end of the first half of the Thunder’s Game 3 rout of the Warriors, Westbrook kicked out his legs as Green fouled him in the act of shooting about 30 feet from the basket, tripping Green up.

Before moving on to prepare his team for an almost must-win Game 4, Warriors Coach Steve Kerr made one concession in an otherwise unwavering defense of his man. Green, he said, had become an ardent practitioner of bodily deception.

“Flailing, flopping — the league is rampant with that,” Kerr said.

But should that line of defense essentially spare a player who endangers another with intentional recklessness? A league that has suspended stars and settled outcomes of series (see Knicks-Miami, 1997; Phoenix-San Antonio, 2007) for wandering harmlessly off the bench upon the outbreak of a fight apparently thought so.

Cleveland’s Jones got a one-game suspension for his hit on Biyombo, but Green’s flagrant-1 foul was upgraded to flagrant-2, meaning he is now a flagrant-1 call away from an automatic one-game suspension for the balance of the playoffs. Green was also fined $25,000.

Kiki Vandeweghe, the league’s executive vice president for basketball operations, called Green’s action “unnecessary and excessive.” Yet Green will be available for Kerr, whose immediate concern is that flailing and flopping is analogous to the Warriors’ predicament, as they trail by two games to one and are desperate to win in a hostile environment against a team that finished 18 games behind Golden State’s record 73 victories.

“They’re the most talented team we’ve faced over the last couple of years, for sure,” Kerr said before making his players re-experience on video the horror of their 41-point third-quarter deficit in Game 3.

Certainly the Thunder are healthier than the Memphis Grizzlies and the Cavaliers were last spring, when Golden State rallied from deficits of two games to one against both teams on its way to the franchise’s first title since 1975.

In Game 3, Billy Donovan, the Thunder’s N.B.A. rookie coach, liberally used a small lineup — normally Kerr’s choice deployment — that spaced the floor for Westbrook and Kevin Durant and outscored the Warriors by 30. With their overall positional height and bigger frontline, the Thunder had a 14-rebound advantage.

Notorious for blowing games with undisciplined fourth-quarter antics, the Thunder have won six of their last eight games against San Antonio and Golden State, teams that combined for 140 regular-season victories.

Did three successive wins over the five-time champion Spurs galvanize the Thunder, raising a level of belief to match their considerable and diverse skills? Can Westbrook and Durant be beaten by anyone if they play to their full potential?

Beware the team that peaks in postseason. The Warriors, conversely, have nursed Stephen Curry through an injury-challenged spring. They are also facing an Oklahoma City front line that athletically overmatches Andrew Bogut and in Game 3 had Green sputtering and in a (flagrant) foul mood.

“That’s what frustrated me — I was just bad,” Green said, leaving us to wonder if he did, after all, take it all out on Adams.

For all the fluid and matter-of-fact majesty of Curry, Green is the Warriors’ alter ego, their emotional leader and multipurpose engine.

If passivity was their primary problem Sunday, they will need more Green-related passion for Game 4, less California cool, to match the Thunder’s combustibility.

“He needs to refocus a little bit, and he’ll admit it,” Kerr said of Green’s penchant for walking a fine line between advancing chemistry and creating chaos.

When the Warriors played here Feb. 27, he delivered a halftime locker room tirade, reportedly angry about his role in the offense. Curry blew America’s minds that Saturday night with a 46-point display of long-range shooting in a nationally televised game that the Warriors stole from the Thunder in overtime. Green wound up missing all eight of his shots but dominated everywhere else with 14 rebounds, 14 assists and 6 steals.

If any one game seemed to cement the respective reputations of the conference finalists, it was that one. This series is far from over, but the Thunder’s character — or perceived lack of it — was apparently not set in stone.

The beauty of the playoffs is their capricious nature, their potential to erase all that has happened, and in this case force the most decorated team in regular-season history to once again demonstrate its fortitude and worth.

“We need to win a game on their home floor, and if we do that, we’re in really good shape,” Kerr said.

If not, 73-9 will feel like ancient history compared with 1-3.
