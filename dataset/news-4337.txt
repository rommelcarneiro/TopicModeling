OKLAHOMA CITY — Given time to sleep on the N.B.A.’s decision to punish but not suspend him for his now infamous kicking of Steven Adams in the groin, the Golden State Warriors’ Draymond Green insisted he would not become tentative, or unemotional, against the Oklahoma City Thunder.

“I’m never going to be careful,” he said after a morning shoot-around for Game 4 of the Western Conference finals later Tuesday night at Chesapeake Energy Arena.

He wasn’t being defiant, or flippant, explaining, “I’m an emotional player,” and noting that the Warriors, trailing in the series, two games to one, needed all the passion they could muster against a Thunder team brimming with talent and growing in confidence.

But Green, whose flagrant-1 foul on Adams in Game 3 was upgraded to a flagrant 2 by the league on Monday, will begin the night only a point — or one flagrant 1 — away from an automatic one-game suspension.

Steve Kerr, his coach, understood the delicate nature of Green’s predicament.

“Draymond is going to have to be very careful,” Kerr said. “He’s got to understand the circumstances, which he does.”

In ruling on the incident, which occurred in the second quarter of Game 3, the N.B.A. called Green’s action “excessive and unnecessary.” But according to a league spokesman, it was difficult to ascertain if Green had acted deliberately, which he steadfastly claimed he had not.

Kevin Durant, after the Thunder’s shoot-around for Game 4, said he and his teammates didn’t give the suspension speculation much thought, suggesting that the league was not about to meddle with a marquee series in which the defending champion Warriors suddenly found themselves in a desperate situation — win on the road, or face elimination on Thursday at home and possibly again here Saturday night in Game 6.

Of Green, Durant said: “He’s one of the best players in the league on arguably one of the best teams” in the history of the league. “They’re not going to suspend Draymond Green. The league is pro-business. We’re not upset about it; that’s just how it goes.”

But Kerr and the Warriors also knew what awaited Green on Tuesday night: a hostile crowd and a big, rugged Thunder front line — featuring Adams, the emerging 7-foot center, whose athletic, physical play in all likelihood was what frustrated and provoked Green in the first place.

Green played coy on that note, saying, “When we focus on us, as opposed to what anybody else got going on, that’s when we’re at our best.”
