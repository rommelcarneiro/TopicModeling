In this episode of Modern Love: The Podcast, the “Saturday Night Live” cast member Cecily Strong reads the Modern Love essay “When the Doorman Is Your Main Man,” by Julie Margaret Hogben.

The 2015 essay is Ms. Hogben’s story of how she formed a bond with her Manhattan doorman, Guzim, as a young woman dating in New York who ultimately became a single mother.

You can also hear the episode on iTunes and Stitcher.

Stay tuned for a surprise guest at the end of the reading.

[Spoiler Alert: He’s the doorman, Guzim.]

Ms. Hogben is the author of “Ally Hughes Has Sex Sometimes,” written under the pen name Jules Moulin, which comes out in paperback on June 14. You can follow her on Twitter at @jmoulinauthor.

Ms. Strong can be seen in the coming remake of “Ghostbusters” this summer. You can follow her on Facebook and Instagram.
