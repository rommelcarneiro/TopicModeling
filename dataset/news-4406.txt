LONDON — The London-based financial services firm Old Mutual said on Tuesday that it was approached by several potential buyers interested in its controlling stake in OM Asset Management.

The company, which is listed in London and Johannesburg, said in March that it would split into four main businesses. Old Mutual’s operations include insurance, asset management and banking.

Old Mutual decided to pursue a breakup after a strategic review announced in November when the former Standard Bank executive Bruce Hemphill took over as chief executive.

The company did not indicate who had approached it regarding the OM Asset Management stake.

“There can be no certainty that these approaches will lead to any transaction or any certainty as to the terms on which any such transaction might proceed,” the company said in a news release on Tuesday.

The announcement followed a report by The Financial Times on Tuesday that Old Mutual was nearing a deal to sell its stake in OM Asset Management to Affiliated Managers Group.

On Tuesday, Old Mutual said it would continue to “assess the options available to it” regarding the separation and would update the market when appropriate. As a result of its decision, Old Mutual said that it expected to periodically receive interest in its assets.

The company, which was founded in 1845 in South Africa, has said that it expected the separation to be largely completed by the end of 2018.

The company’s four units are Old Mutual Emerging Markets, Old Mutual Wealth, Nedbank Group and OM Asset Management.
