The mass killings in Orlando will overtake events in Washington and dominate Congress this week as lawmakers seek answers and possible responses in the wake of the United States’ deadliest shooting attack.

Public and classified briefings were already being scheduled on Sunday to allow lawmakers and others to hear from law enforcement officials on what happened as well as on whether any links to terrorism contributed to the attack.

The House and Senate will honor the victims of the shooting and the emergency personnel who responded, and lawmakers will no doubt take their opportunities to offer condolences and perspectives.

The political aspects of the attack were inescapable, given an episode that contains elements of Islamic extremism, gay rights, gun control and more in the final months of an already heated national campaign year.

Senator Christopher S. Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat and gun control advocate, said on Sunday that Congress had “become complicit in these murders” by failing to act to limit the availability of guns. Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, said the killings showed that “violent Islam, whether its card-carrying members of ISIS or Al Qaeda or its crowdsourced attackers, must be defeated.”

Whatever one’s view, the killings meant a summer legislative week in Washington that was supposed to be devoted mainly to Pentagon policy has been tragically changed.
