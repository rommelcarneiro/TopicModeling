Four significant things happened in the last 24 hours of the 2016 presidential race:

President Obama forcefully denounced Donald J. Trump, the Republican running to succeed him, for playing to the nation’s worst fears in the wake of the deadly mass shooting in Orlando, Fla. Mr. Trump stood by his insinuations that Mr. Obama is sympathetic to terrorists.

Hillary Clinton, defending Mr. Obama, whom she also wants to succeed, painted Mr. Trump as something of an oddball in addition to criticizing his statements about immigration and aggressively profiling Muslims. And yet another national poll, this time from Bloomberg Politics, showed Mrs. Clinton opening a double-digit lead over Mr. Trump.

According to the survey, 63 percent of women said they could never vote for Mr. Trump, a staggeringly high number that presents him with a daunting challenge.

Mr. Trump’s drop in some national polls is most likely connected to self-inflicted wounds, including his comments that the Indiana-born federal judge overseeing a case against Trump University could not be partial because he was “Mexican.” But there is another explanation.

Since shortly after Mr. Trump became the presumptive nominee in early May, the “super PAC” supporting Mrs. Clinton, Priorities USA, has aired ads in battleground states portraying him as disrespectful and even offensive to women.

Those ads have gone unanswered by Mr. Trump’s campaign for a month now, as his team, plagued by internal battles, has struggled with fundamental staff moves, like naming a political director, and with raising money as donors decline to lend their names to fund-raising events.
