Instead of a lobster roll, how about a grilled lobster tail, sold from a cart in the Battery run by the people at Luke’s Lobster? The cart serves meaty five- and eight-ounce tails still in the shell from sustainably sourced Maine and Canadian lobsters. They are skewered, seared and offered with either lemon butter or Maine blueberry sauce. The sturdy wooden skewer allows you to yank the luscious meat from the shell and eat it off the skewer like corn on the cob: Lobster tails from $6 (for five-ounce, $11 for two) to $10 (for eight-ounce, $19 for two), Luke’s Tail Cart, State and Water Streets at the Battery, steps from the SeaGlass carousel, lukeslobster.com.
