The stock market fell for a fifth straight day Wednesday as investors set aside the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision and remained focused on next week’s vote on whether Britain would remain in the European Union.

The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 3.82 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,071.50, and the Nasdaq composite fell 8.62 points, or 0.2 percent, to 4,834.93.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 34.65 points, or 0.2 percent, to 17,640.17.

As expected, the Federal Reserve voted to keep interest rates unchanged at their current level of 0.25 to 0.50 percent. In its statement, the Fed said that while United States economic activity continued to strengthen, “the pace of improvement in the labor market has slowed,” a reference to the April and May job reports that were weaker than anticipated.

Kristina Hooper, head of United States investment strategies at Allianz Global Investors, said after the decision was announced, “They needed to hit the pause button for June, but I think a July rate hike still remains a distinct possibility.”

United States government bond prices remained high, keeping yields low. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.58 percent from 1.61 percent a day earlier. Bond investors said the uncertainty about the British vote had forced European investors to buy up United States government bonds in a search for yield and security, pushing bond yields to their lowest levels in years.

“We are in a rare moment where the highest-quality creditor, the United States, is also the creditor with the highest interest rate,” said Brandon Swensen, senior portfolio manager and co-head of United States fixed income at RBC Global Asset Management.

Most investors remained focused on the other side of the Atlantic. There is considerable uncertainty about whether British voters will choose, in a June 23 referendum, to leave the European Union, referred to as a Brexit. The repercussions of such a move are not clear.

During her news conference, the Fed’s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, said the coming vote was one of the reasons the central bank kept interest rates unchanged.

Ms. Hooper of Allianz said a potential Brexit had “not loomed as large with investors as it should have.”

In economic data, the Fed said on Wednesday that industrial output — which includes factories, mines and utilities — dropped 0.4 percent from April. The decline reversed the 0.6 percent gain seen between April and March, an improvement that was taken as a sign the industrial economy was turning around.

“The industrial side of the U.S. economy remains under pressure,” said Gus Faucher, deputy chief economist at the PNC Financial Services Group.

Manufacturing fell 0.4 percent last month, as motor vehicle production tumbled 4.4 percent. Mining production rose 0.2 percent, helped by a rebound in coal, but remained down 11.5 percent from a year ago. Utilities slipped 1 percent.

In a separate report, the Labor Department said that its Producer Price Index, which measures inflation pressures before they reach the consumer, increased 0.4 percent in May after a 0.2 percent rise in April. It was the biggest gain since a similar 0.4 percent increase in January.

Core inflation, which excludes energy and food, was up 0.3 percent in May, an acceleration from a modest 0.1 percent rise in April, indicating that inflation, which has been below the Fed’s preferred 2 percent pace, could be starting to accelerate.

Among individual companies, Whole Foods Market shares fell $1.62, or 5 percent, to $30.90 after the Food and Drug Administration said there were “serious violations” at a kitchen in Massachusetts that may have resulted in contaminated food and the grocery chain had not done enough to fix them.

Benchmark United States crude oil fell 48 cents to close at $48.01 a barrel in New York. The price has fallen 6.3 percent over the last five days. Brent crude, used to price international oils, fell 86 cents to close at $48.97 a barrel in London.

In other energy commodities, wholesale gasoline futures fell 2 cents, to $1.50 a gallon; heating oil closed down 2 cents, to $1.48 a gallon; and natural gas fell 1 cent, to $2.595 per 1,000 cubic feet.

The dollar fell to 106.01 yen from 106.12 yen. The euro edged up to $1.1251 from $1.1204.

Gold prices rose 20 cents, to $1,285.80 an ounce. Silver rose 8 cents, to $17.50 an ounce, and copper closed up 5 cents, to $2.091 a pound.
