“The Humans” and “Shuffle Along” each earned four awards, with “The Humans” winning for outstanding play and “Shuffle Along” for outstanding musical, at the Drama Desk Awards on Sunday night.

The 61st annual awards also honored “The Humans” for outstanding lighting design and sound design, and gave the play a special award for outstanding ensemble. “The Humans,” by Stephen Karam, transferred to Broadway after a critically lauded premiere Off Broadway from the Roundabout Theater Company last fall.

“Shuffle Along,” about the creation and aftermath of a 1921 musical of the same title, also took home awards for outstanding choreography (Savion Glover), costume design and wig and hair design.

The awards were for Broadway, Off Broadway and Off Off Broadway productions that opened during the 2015-16 season. Excluded was “Hamilton,” which is up for a record-breaking 16 nominations at the Tony Awards on June 12 but originally opened during the 2014-15 season at the Public Theater Off Broadway. (It won seven Drama Desk Awards last year.)

Also among the big winners was the Broadway revival of the 1960s Bock and Harnick musical “She Loves Me,” which won for outstanding revival as well as featured actress (Jane Krakowski), orchestration and set design. Ivo van Hove’s stripped-down production of “A View From the Bridge” won for outstanding revival of a play.

Other acting-award winners include Frank Langella (“The Father”); Jessica Lange (“Long Day’s Journey Into Night”); Danny Burstein (“Fiddler on the Roof”); Cynthia Erivo (“The Color Purple”); Michael Shannon (“Long Day’s Journey Into Night”); Saycon Sengbloh (“Eclipsed”); and Christopher Fitzgerald (“Waitress”).
