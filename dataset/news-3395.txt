A New York City police captain who declined to help when two officers were injured in a shootout in Brooklyn has been demoted, the Police Department said on Wednesday.

The former captain, Scott J. Forster, 32, was demoted to lieutenant three months after the predawn shooting on Feb. 20 in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood that left Officers William Reddin and Andrew Yurkiw injured, according to the police.

Officers Reddin and Yurkiw were taken to Kings County Hospital Center, located within the 71st Precinct, where Lieutenant Forster was the executive officer. Instead of staying to help coordinate the police response at the hospital, police officials said at the time, he left 40 minutes after the shooting when his shift ended, and later claimed he was sick.

Shortly after the shooting, Lieutenant Forster was stripped of his badge and gun and relegated to an administrative role. He had served more than 10 years with the Police Department and had been promoted to captain last summer. He was within his one-year probationary period for that rank when the shooting occurred.
