KulturfestNYC, the National Yiddish Theater Folksbiene’s Jewish performing arts festival that had its debut in 2015, will return this summer, and on a much larger scale.

The first festival, which was years in the making and coincided with the Folksbiene’s 100th anniversary, lasted a week and had more than 50,000 attendees. Now, the organization — along with the Museum of Jewish Heritage and commercial sponsors — is betting on a longer KulturfestNYC, which will run from early June through August.

“Yiddish Soul,” a concert of Eastern European and American music and the centerpiece of last year’s KulturfestNYC, will return to SummerStage in Central Park on June 15. Other concerts will be at Joe’s Pub, City Winery and Robert F. Wagner Park in Lower Manhattan, where the “Stomp”-like Israeli troupe Tararam will perform on Aug. 7.

As previously announced, “Di Goldene Kale” (“The Golden Bride”), a long-lost Yiddish operetta that was reconstructed and staged by the Folksbiene in late 2015, will return to the Museum of Jewish Heritage from July 4 through Aug. 28. The entire original cast will return for the production, which sold out and was a Critics’ Pick in The New York Times.

The festival also includes additional theatrical productions at the Baruch Performing Arts Center, as well as street fairs, talks and events, like a singalong screening of the 1971 movie musical “Fiddler on the Roof,” with cast members (June 19 at the Museum of Jewish Heritage).
