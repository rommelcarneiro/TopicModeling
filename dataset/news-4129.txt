“Cats” has found its Grizabella.

Leona Lewis, a British pop star (and animal rights activist) will take on the role in a revival of “Cats” that is scheduled to open on Broadway in July.

The casting of the Glamour Cat (that’s Grizabella) has been much anticipated since Andrew Lloyd Webber, who wrote the music for “Cats,” declared himself “furious” with Nicole Scherzinger, who played the role in London, for allegedly pulling out of the role in New York. Grizabella has the show’s most famous song, “Memory”; the role won Betty Buckley a Tony Award when the show made its debut on Broadway in 1983.

Trevor Nunn, who directed the original, will oversee the revival. Andy Blankenbuehler, who is the Tony-nominated choreographer of “Hamilton,” takes on the same job for “Cats.”

Among others in the new cast: “So You Think You Can Dance” champion Ricky Ubeda as Mr. Mistoffelees and Quentin Earl Darrington as Old Deuteronomy.
