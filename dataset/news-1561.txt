CAIRO — The flight data recorder from EgyptAir Flight 804, which crashed in the Mediterranean last month, has been recovered, Egyptian investigators said on Friday, one day after announcing that the cockpit voice recorder had been found.

The crew of the John Lethbridge, a research vessel involved in the search, found the wreckage of the plane, the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder.

“The vessel equipment managed to pick up the memory unit, which is considered as the most important part of the above-mentioned recorder,” the Egyptian Aircraft Accident Investigation Committee said.

It added that investigators had been notified, and that the two data recorders would be transferred in Alexandria, Egypt, to the committee “to carry out analysis and unload the voice conversations.”

The recorders are now on their way to the investigative committee’s lab in Cairo for inspection, investigators said.

An Egyptian aviation official said Friday that the cockpit voice recorder appeared to have been “crushed” during the crash, but that the flight data recorder “looked fine more or less.”

It will take several days to determine the extent of the damage, the official added. The official was not authorized to speak to the news media about the investigation and requested anonymity.

All 66 people aboard the Airbus A320 jetliner bound for Cairo from Paris were killed in the still-unexplained crash on May 19.
