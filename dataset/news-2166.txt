Elizabeth Anne Brodsky, a daughter of Katherine J. Brodsky of Clayton, Mo., and Roger J. Brodsky of St. Louis, was married on June 11 to Zachary Andrew Portin, a son of Susan F. Portin and Robert J. Portin of Amherst, N.Y. Rabbi James M. Bennett officiated at Westwood Country Club in St. Louis.

The bride, 27, is a fourth-year medical student at the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine. She graduated from Colgate University.

The groom, 29, is an associate in the Philadelphia office of Reed Smith, a Pittsburgh law firm. He also graduated from Colgate, summa cum laude, and later received a law degree cum laude from Washington University in St. Louis.

The couple met in 2010 at O’Hare Airport in Chicago while waiting to board the same flight to St. Louis. On the flight, they sat next to each other, and upon landing, both discovered that their luggage had been delayed in Chicago. The bride offered to pick up and deliver the groom’s bags to him once they arrived. He agreed, on the condition that she join him for lunch after delivery. The next day, they made good on their deal.
