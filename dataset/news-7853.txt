The artist Olafur Eliasson may be best known in New York for creating four waterfalls in 2008 on the East River, the most famous of which was off the Brooklyn Bridge. Now his studio has created no ordinary cookbook. Besides the mostly black-and-white photographs showing his dynamic headquarters in Berlin and the communal cooking and dining events there, the book includes vegetarian recipes to serve six or, as happens in the studio, 60. “It started smaller, but lunch was a time when we came together in the studio,” Mr. Eliasson said in an interview in New York last month. “It was also cheaper, better and healthier for us to cook.” Alice Waters, who Mr. Eliasson got to know at a Davos conference, also figures in the book. Home cooks may focus on the three-cheese quiche, a lemon pasta, a sublime version of egg-drop soup and the use of caramelized soy sauce: “The Kitchen” by Studio Olafur Eliasson (Phaidon $49.95).
