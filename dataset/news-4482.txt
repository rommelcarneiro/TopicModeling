The Nile crocodile, which inhabits sub-Saharan Africa, can grow to 21 feet long and weigh one and a half tons. It eats just about anything — including humans.

Now four have been found in Florida, although none were that large. They were probably brought from South Africa and kept as pets or zoo displays.

One was a hatchling about a foot long sitting on a porch in Miami. Another was found on the property of a private zoo in Homestead, Fla., and a third, a 10-pound female, was captured in a public park, also in Homestead.

Finally, five months later, in March 2012, a three-foot-long female was trapped in a canal in Homestead. This one was tagged and released.

She turned up again two years later and 18 miles away, having grown to five and a half feet long.

Kenneth L. Krysko, an author of the study that describes the animals, said that there was no indication that the crocodiles were reproducing.

Still, he said, “This is a very big predator, and now we’ve introduced it into Florida. This is not a good thing.”
