The Baltimore Museum of Art has chosen a new director.

Christopher Bedford, the director of the Rose Art Museum at Brandeis University, will in August succeed Doreen Bolger, who served as the Baltimore Museum’s director from 1998 until her retirement in 2015.

Mr. Bedford hopes “to amplify its greatness in all areas,” he said in a telephone interview, “but also reconsider and redefine — and perhaps become a model for — civic engagement.” He was recently named the commissioner for the United States Pavilion for the 2017 Venice Biennale, which will present a new installation by Mark Bradford.

Before becoming director of the Rose in 2012 Mr. Bedford held curatorial positions at the Wexner Center for the Arts in Ohio, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the J. Paul Getty Museum.

The Baltimore Museum, which turned 100 in 2014, recently raised $80.7 million, added nearly 4,000 art donations to the collection and completed a $28-million renovation.
