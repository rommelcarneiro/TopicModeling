Ilene Chaiken, the showrunner of “Empire,” is taking questions from readers of The New York Times.

Created by Lee Daniels and Danny Strong, “Empire” made its debut on Fox last year and was the sort of prime-time phenomenon broadcast networks rarely generate anymore. Its ratings increased throughout its inaugural season as it became one of the most watched series on TV and made a star of Taraji P. Henson.

The second season of this music business melodrama, which wraps up May 18, finds it routinely topping the weekly ratings, suggesting the show could have staying power despite — or perhaps because of — its dizzying number of plot twists each episode.

Before “Empire,” Ms. Chaiken was a creator of “The L Word” on Showtime. She was also a producer on “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” early in her career.

Please leave questions for her in the comments. We will post her responses to some of them soon.

Previously we heard from Joe Weisberg and Joel Fields of “The Americans” and Robert Carlock of “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,” among others.
