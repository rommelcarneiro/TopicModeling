Marcus Lemonis is well known for writing checks to fund small businesses as the star of CNBC’s “The Profit.” His company may soon receive a large cash infusion of its own.

Camping World, where Mr. Lemonis is chairman and chief executive, is readying an initial public offering, people briefed on the discussions said. The company, which sells recreational vehicles and other products for camping, is aiming to generate $350 million in proceeds, said these people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase are helping to manage the I.P.O., which is expected this year, pending market receptivity, these people said.

Mr. Lemonis took an unusual path to the R.V. industry. He was born in Beirut, Lebanon, in the 1970s and lived in an orphanage until an American family adopted him at 9 months old. His adoptive parents owned a Chevrolet dealership in Florida, which spurred his interest in cars and entrepreneurship. He started Camping World R.V. Supercenters after acquiring more than 100 R.V. companies.

Camping World and its financing affiliate, Good Sam Enterprises, are partly owned by the private equity firm Crestview. The two businesses were combined in 2010, according to their website.

Representatives from Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Crestview declined to comment. Media contacts at Camping World did not reply to a request seeking comment.

Camping World sells more than 8,000 products through more than 100 retail stores and online. The company says on its website that its annual revenue exceeds $1.7 billion.

On “The Profit,” Mr. Lemonis offers capital to small businesses and then advises their managements. In November, he told Business Insider that he had invested about $35 million through the show and had lost several million in the process.
