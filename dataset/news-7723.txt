The world of obituary writing comes alive in Vanessa Gould’s documentary “Obit,” which premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival.

The full length documentary takes an inside look at The Times’ obituaries department and the way the staff puts together the last words on the famous and infamous.

In this podcast, the obituaries section editor (and one of the movie’s stars), William McDonald talks about “Obit,” the movie, and obits the job. (And supplies useful information to those who would like to get a Times obit for a loved one: “Send an email,” says Mr. McDonald, “We don’t dismiss anyone out of hand.”)

Susan Lehman is host.
