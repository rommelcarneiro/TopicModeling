Twitter has invested about $70 million in the streaming music service SoundCloud in a deal that may help both companies attract more users.

Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s chief executive, confirmed that the company’s investment in a statement to the technology news site Recode on Tuesday.

He did not specify the amount, and a spokeswoman for Twitter declined to comment. But the figure was confirmed by a person who had been briefed on the deal.

“Earlier this year, we made an investment in SoundCloud through Twitter Ventures to help support some of our efforts with creators,” Mr. Dorsey said. “They’ve been great partners of ours over the years, and their community-supported approach mirrors ours in many ways.”

The deal will mean needed funds for SoundCloud, which has struggled with losses despite establishing itself as a popular online outlet for new music. It could clarify how Twitter deals with entertainment, an area in which the company has stumbled in the past.

SoundCloud opened in 2008 and became a favorite of musicians and fans, attracting what it says are 175 million users worldwide. At the same time, the company drew the ire of the major record labels for hosting unlicensed content, which made it vulnerable to copyright liability.

In 2014, Twitter considered buying SoundCloud, but abandoned the deal. Since then, SoundCloud has struck new licensing deals with record companies and publishers, helping to legitimize the service with the mainstream music business.

In March, SoundCloud introduced its long-promised subscription service, SoundCloud Go, making a catalog of more than 125 million songs available to people at $10 a month, with a free version supported by advertising.

In SoundCloud’s financial filings for 2014, released early this year, the company reported $19.5 million in revenue but a loss of almost $44 million, and said it would need to raise money to stay in business. Last year, it raised $77 million in debt.

In a statement, a SoundCloud spokeswoman said the investment from Twitter would “enable SoundCloud to remain focused on building value for creators and listeners alike.”
