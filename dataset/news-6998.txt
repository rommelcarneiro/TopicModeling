Good evening. Here’s the latest.

1. Donald J. Trump won Indiana’s Republican primary, delivering a crushing blow that led Senator Ted Cruz to end his presidential campaign. Mr. Trump is now the nominee in all but name only. Bernie Sanders rebounded to win the Democratic primary, but Hillary Clinton still holds a large enough lead in delegates that she remains the favorite to win the Democratic nomination.

2. The voting was overshadowed most of the day by bitter sparring between the two top Republicans. Mr. Trump accused Ted Cruz’s father of associating with President Kennedy’s assassin, repeating an assertion made by The National Enquirer. Mr. Cruz called Mr. Trump a “pathological liar,” “utterly amoral” and a “narcissist at a level I don’t think this country has ever seen.”

3. A court in New York sentenced Sheldon Silver, the disgraced former Assembly speaker, to 12 years in prison for crimes including fraud, money laundering and extortion. The trial exposed the culture of graft in Albany. Mr. Sheldon, 72, said he was “truly, truly sorry" for letting down his constituents, family and colleagues.

4. “It’s unbelievable — it’s absolutely humbling and incredible.” That was Lin-Manuel Miranda, the creator and star of “Hamilton,” as the show broke yet another Broadway record, garnering 16 Tony nominations. The recognition covered every theatrical category and epitomized the most diverse season in Broadway history. Most of us can’t get tickets, but check out the clip above.

5. A Navy SEAL was killed in northern Iraq, the third U.S. service member to die in combat as part of an American-led coalition fighting the Islamic State. A Pentagon spokesman said the coalition would “honor this sacrifice” by dealing ISIS “a lasting defeat.” Above, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter in Germany.

6. New doubts arose about this iconic World War II photograph of the U.S. flag being raised on Iwo Jima. It seems that the photo did not, after all, include John Bradley, a Navy corpsman. Mr. Bradley helped raise the flag earlier the same day, but is not in the photograph of this flag-raising, despite representations in his son’s book, “Flags of Our Fathers,” the basis for a Clint Eastwood film.

7. This may come as no surprise to New Yorkers, or visitors who’ve been on the move at rush hour. A surge in ridership — nearing 1.8 billion rides a year — is pushing the city’s century-old subway system to its limit. Train operators approach crowded stations slowly, mindful, as one said, that “somebody could be pushed or someone could fall or trip or faint.”

8. Speaking of rides and fainting, Brazil is considering an idea for an erotic theme park, with evocative sculptures, a “sex playground” and bumper cars designed like genitalia — but no sex. “It’s not like we’re trying to recreate Sodom and Gomorrah,” a main backer said. (We learned this via What in the World, The Times’s new showcase for compelling international tidbits.)

9. Eight prominent women in Silicon Valley unveiled a data-driven effort to help diversify the tech world’s predominantly white male work force. Among Project Include’s creators: Ellen Pao, whose gender-discrimination suit became a focal point for women in tech, and Erica Baker, who helped reveal startling pay disparities among Google workers.

10. In more than a dozen states, critics of efforts to ease gun laws increasingly include the local police. “We are a gun society and we recognize that, but we should be writing gun laws that make us safer,” said a Mississippi police chief. “Do you want every incident on your street to escalate to acts of gun violence?”

_____

11. The U.S. government is resettling Native American residents of a sinking Louisiana island before they become “climate refugees.” It’s among the first climate-inspired mass relocations anywhere. “We see this as setting a precedent for the rest of the country, the rest of the world,” an official said.
