Carty and Stanley J. Kozlowski, also of Rochester Hills. Dr. Julia A. Rudolf, a friend of the couple who became a Universal Life minister for the event, officiated at the Ford Piquette Avenue Plant in Detroit, which is now a museum and event space.

The bride, 28, is simultaneously studying for an M.B.A. at M.I.T. and a master’s degree in public policy at Harvard, from which she received an undergraduate degree summa cum laude.

Until March, the groom, 27, was a software developer at Bloomberg, the financial news company in New York. He graduated from the University of Michigan and received a master’s degree in finance from Case Western Reserve University.

The couple met in 2001 at the audition for their middle-school show choir, and began dating during a high school production of “Fiddler on the Roof.”
