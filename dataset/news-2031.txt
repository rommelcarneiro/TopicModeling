United States and global stocks fell for a third day on Monday, as concerned investors waited to see what the Federal Reserve would do with interest rates later this week and anxiously awaited Britain’s decision on membership in the European Union.

LinkedIn shares jumped after Microsoft announced plans to buy the company.

The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 17.01 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,079.06 and the Nasdaq composite fell 46.11 points, or 0.9 percent, to 4,848.44.

The Dow Jones industrial average lost 132.86 points, or 0.7 percent, to 17,732.48.

The Federal Reserve’s two-day meeting will start on Tuesday, and a decision on interest rates is expected Wednesday afternoon. The central bank’s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, is scheduled to hold a news conference after the interest rate decision.

For months, the Fed had said that once economic data showed a consistently healthy economy, it would be time to resume raising interest rates. But after the government issued a surprisingly bleak hiring report for May, most Fed-watchers predicted the next rate increase would be put off until the fall.

On Wednesday, the Fed is expected to echo the message Ms. Yellen sent in a speech last week: While the United States economy looks fundamentally solid and higher rates will come eventually, too many uncertainties exist.

Among them is a June 23 referendum in Britain, nicknamed Brexit, over whether to leave the European Union. A yes vote could roil financial markets, and the Fed is unlikely to want to further unnerve investors with a rate increase just a week before that vote.

Some recent polls have shown that a majority of British voters are in favor of exiting the E.U.

Given the interest in Brexit, “this week’s Fed meeting feels like a bit of a sideshow,” said John Briggs, head of strategy for the Americas at RBS, in a note to investors.

Economists who foresee no rate increases before September say the Fed will not have a clear enough picture of the economy before then. The biggest uncertainty is whether the job market has succumbed to a prolonged slump or is merely enduring a brief pause. Other economic barometers have also sowed doubts, like tepid consumer spending and stresses from China and other major economies.

“While the global economy has stabilized in the sense that it is not dropping like a rock, global economic growth remains anemic at best,” said Sung Won Sohn, an economics professor at California State University, Channel Islands. “Given all the uncertainties on economic growth and continued low inflation, there is no need to rush to hike interest rates.”

However, the Fed does not want to lead investors to inflate the prices of stocks and other assets out of a mistaken belief that it will keep rates ultralow well into the future. The need to discourage such excessive risk-taking is why even analysts who think the economy still faces challenges predict that the Fed will nevertheless raise rates at least once this year.

“The Fed wants to keep markets’ feet to the fire, but they do not want to hike rates so much that they exacerbate an economic slowdown,” said Brian Bethune, an economics professor at Tufts University. “They want to turn the crank slowly.”

The uncertainty over the Fed’s plans could be seen on Monday in bonds and the dollar. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.61 percent from 1.64 percent on Friday, its lowest yield so far this year. The dollar, while off its lows, is still trading near its lows for the year against other major currencies.

Brexit, combined with the weight of the Fed decision, kept stocks in Europe under pressure. The DAX in Germany closed down 1.8 percent, the CAC-40 in France fell 1.9 percent and the British FTSE 100 fell 1.2 percent.

Shares of the professional social networking site LinkedIn soared $61.13, or 47 percent, to $192.21 after Microsoft announced it was purchasing the company for $26.2 billion in cash. Shares of Microsoft fell $1.34, or 2.6 percent, to $50.14 after the deal was announced.

Twitter shares jumped as well, up 53 cents, or 4 percent, to $14.55 on speculation that LinkedIn’s buyout could mean better buyout prospects for that social media service.

The security software company Symantec jumped 91 cents, or 5 percent, to $18.21 after it said it would purchase another security company, Blue Coat, for $4.6 billion. Blue Coat had plans to go public later this year. Symantec was the biggest gainer in the S.&P. 500.

In currencies, the dollar fell to 106.21 yen from 106.79 yen. The dollar fell slightly against the euro to $1.1291 and rose slightly against the British pound to $1.423.

United States crude fell 19 cents, to $48.88 a barrel. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil prices, fell 19 cents, to $50.35 a barrel in London. Oil prices had reached 11-month highs in the last few days.

In other energy commodities, heating oil was effectively unchanged at $1.515 a gallon. Wholesale gasoline futures fell 2 cents, to $1.536 a gallon, and natural gas rose 3 cents, to $2.585 per thousand cubic feet.

In the metals markets, gold rose $11, to $1,286.90 an ounce. Silver rose 11 cents, to $17.44 an ounce, and copper rose 2 cents, to $2.054 a pound.
