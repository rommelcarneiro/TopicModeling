The Brooklyn Museum is offering voluntary buyouts to address a budget deficit of about $3 million, the museum’s director, Anne Pasternak, informed the staff on Wednesday.

“It’s a course correction,” Ms. Pasternak said in a telephone interview.

The museum, which has an operating budget of $38.6 million, joins the Metropolitan Museum of Art and MoMA, both of which also recently announced staff cutbacks.

The museum has a full-time staff of 308, including 19 curators and departments from ancient Egyptian to contemporary and feminist art.

Since Ms. Pasternak took over in September, she said she had been looking at the budget and trying to reduce expenses.

“The cost of running the museum has substantially grown over the past few years,” she said, adding that “the museum is therefore being proactive.”
