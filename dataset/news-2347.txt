Senator Bernie Sanders plans to meet with several of his most important supporters and advisers in Burlington, Vt., on Sunday, as he faces increasing pressure to drop out of the Democratic presidential race.

The Vermont senator and his wife, Jane, will both attend the meeting that will center, in part, on the state of the race.

“He and Jane invited a couple dozen key supporters from around the country to come to Burlington,” Michael Briggs, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders, said. “It will be a broad-ranging discussion.”

While Hillary Clinton now has enough delegates to clinch the nomination, Mr. Sanders has refused to concede.

President Obama endorsed Mrs. Clinton on Thursday and called her the most qualified candidate ever to seek the White House, imploring Democrats to unite behind her. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who had carefully stayed out of the race, also endorsed Mrs. Clinton.

Mr. Briggs said Mr. Sanders was committed to remaining in the race at least through Tuesday, when Washington, D.C., will hold the final contest of the primary season. He also said Mr. Sanders might be traveling back to campaign in Washington before its primary.

Mr. Sanders may be staying in the race to pressure the Democratic Party to inject more progressive ideals — like the call for a $15 federal minimum wage — into the Democratic platform at the national convention next month.

Meanwhile, he did not utter Mrs. Clinton’s name at a Thursday night rally he held in Washington, and he has not commented on Mrs. Clinton’s new endorsements.
