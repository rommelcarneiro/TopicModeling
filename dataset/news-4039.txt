Arthur Russell, the singer-songwriter-composer-cellist who died in 1992, made his own original connections between minimalism and experimental music, disco, country and folk, and top-40 pop. It may be hard to understand any artist with such lack of anxiety around genre, but Russell was hard to understand in other ways, too: his lyrics could be open-ended or sung in a warm blur; his compositional method could be based in numbers or esoterica. His importance has grown slowly since his death, to the point where he has become a common reference in alternative and not-so-alternative culture. Recently his song “Answers Me” was sampled by Kanye West on “The Life of Pablo.”

If there are remaining mysteries around Russell that haven’t been addressed in Matt Wolf’s 2008 documentary “Wild Combination” or Tim Lawrence’s 2009 biography “Hold On to Your Dreams,” they may be solved by looking through (and listening to) his archives — 166 linear feet of papers and tapes — which have just been acquired by the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. Recently I investigated Russell’s archive, and wrote about it for Arts & Leisure. On this week’s Popcast, Jon Pareles, who saw Russell perform in the mid-1980s at the Kitchen and just heard his piece “Instrumentals” performed last weekend at Moogfest, joins me to talk about Russell’s wide-angle, slow-release significance.
