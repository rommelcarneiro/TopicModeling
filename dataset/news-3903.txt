The Dutch diplomat and poet Constantijn Huygens, referring to a small painting by a 23-year-old upstart named Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn, wrote, “Compare this with all Italy, indeed, with everything beautiful and admirable that has been preserved from the earliest antiquity.”

The dramatic, light-flecked work, which Huygens considered beyond compare and has long been recognized as Rembrandt’s first mature work (and first masterpiece), has been in a private British collection for decades and is rarely exhibited publicly.

But on Friday, June 3, “Judas Returning the Thirty Pieces of Silver” goes on view at the Morgan Library & Museum, the first time it has been shown in the United States, along with works from the Morgan’s own collection that help chart the development of the style that came to define the Baroque.
