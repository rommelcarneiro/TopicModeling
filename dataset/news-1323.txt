A late own goal by Birkir Saevarsson handed Hungary a 1-1 draw with Iceland in Marseille, France, on Saturday in another European Championships match affected by crowd trouble.

Saevarsson turned a cross from Nemanja Nikolic into his own net as Iceland appeared headed to its first victory at a major tournament.

“We were so close,” Iceland forward Kolbeinn Sigthorsson said. “It’s quite a big loss for us, this draw.”

Iceland took the lead in the 40th minute when Gylfi Sigurdsson scored from the penalty spot. After the 88th-minute equalizer, Hungarian fans threw flares that landed among nearby police officers.

Hungary now has 4 points in Group F and looks set to qualify for the round of 16. Iceland has 2 points.

Belgium 3, Ireland 0 After a poor start to the European Championships, Belgium began living up to its promise with a resounding victory over Ireland in Bordeaux, France.

Romelu Lukaku scored two second-half goals as Belgium’s much-vaunted attack finally sprang to life after a disappointing display in an opening 2-0 loss to Italy.

Belgium has 3 points in Group E while Ireland has 1. Belgium plays Sweden next, and a draw would most likely send it to the round of 16. Ireland meets Italy, the group winner.
