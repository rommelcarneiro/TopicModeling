The coming week is a bonanza for lovers of opera rarities. On Sunday, May 1, at the Rose Theater, the dependable company Opera Lafayette offers staged scenes from a three operas on classical subjects that had their premieres during the French Revolution: Martini’s “Sapho,” Cherubini’s “Medée” and Sacchini’s “Oedipe à Colone.” (8 p.m., 60th Street and Broadway, 212-721-6500; jalc.org.)

The action moves to Renaissance Italy on Wednesday, when the Opera Orchestra of New York presents Donizetti’s “Parisina d’Este” at the Rose Theater with that company’s venerable founder, Eve Queler, conducting the soprano Angela Meade in the title role. In the 1970s, Ms. Queler led the opera here, with Montserrat Caballé as Parisina, and some memories surely go back that far. On Friday at Zankel Hall, the early-music maestro Nicholas McGegan and his intrepid ensemble Philharmonia Baroque reintroduce Scarlatti’s long-forgotten opera “La Gloria di Primavera,” first performed in 1716, with a cast that includes Diana Moore, Douglas Williams and Nicholas Phan. (7:30 p.m., 212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org.)
