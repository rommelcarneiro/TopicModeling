Good evening. Here’s the latest.

1. The Defense Department described why a U.S. gunship attacked a hospital run by Doctors Without Borders in Afghanistan last year, killing 42 people. The crew had just come under attack, received the wrong coordinates for the source and mistook the hospital for a Taliban site. Sixteen personnel were disciplined, but none face criminal charges, angering those who see the attack as a war crime. Here’s an explainer that details what officials say happened.

2. Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, now far ahead of their rivals, are gearing up for a one-on-one race. Mr. Trump has already begun attacking Mrs. Clinton in ways many women find sexist, questioning her “strength” and objecting to her “shouting.” Another tactic: criticizing her past support for a womanizing Bill Clinton. Above, Mr. Trump speaking at the California Republican Party convention near San Francisco.

3. The N.F.L. draft goes to Rounds 2 and 3 (7 p.m. Eastern, ESPN/ESPN2, NFL Network). But there’s unlikely to be anything near the drama of Round 1: the sudden fall of Laremy Tunsil, a coveted offensive lineman. A video that appeared to show him smoking marijuana via a gas mask was posted just before Round 1 started Thursday.

_____

4. A graduate student searching 19th-century newspapers found Walt Whitman’s lost treatise on “manly health.” Written under a pseudonym around the same time as some of Whitman’s best-known poems of homoerotic love, the 47,000-word series recommends meat-eating, bare-knuckled boxing, comfortable footwear and avoiding “too much brain action and fretting.”

5. New figures show that countries in the eurozone have finally returned to G.D.P. levels of eight years ago, before the global economic downturn. But entrenched problems remain evident in high unemployment, low inflation and uneven recovery for incomes. “Europe is just sort of hanging on,” one expert said.

_____

6. Palestinian children have joined in the surge of attacks on Israelis, and Israel’s crackdown in response has swept many minors into its justice system. The 12-year-old girl above was released from prison after serving months for being found with a knife near a West Bank settlement entrance. “If she was an Israeli child, it would be impossible under Israeli law to sentence a child this young for an actual jail term,” a rights advocate said.

_____

7. Vice President Joe Biden visited the Vatican for a conference on regenerative medicine, speaking of his faith and the urgent need to find a cure for cancer. Mr. Biden, who lost a son to cancer last year, thanked Pope Francis for meeting with the Biden family during his U.S. tour. “I wish every grieving parent, brother, sister, mother, father would have the benefit of his words, his prayers, his presence,” Mr. Biden said.

_____

8. From the obituary desk: The Canadian entrepreneur Philip Kives, 87. Not ringing a bell? Wait, there’s more! He founded K-tel, the company whose endless ads for compilation albums (“20 Great Truck Drivin’ Songs”) and conveniences like the Veg-o-Matic helped define the small screen in the ’60s and ’70s.

_____

9. A new analysis of reading and math scores from 11,000 U.S. school districts shows just how much race and class matter. Children outpace grade averages as wealth rises and fall behind as poverty grows, with far more white students among the first group and far more minorities among the second. Racial gaps persist even when socioeconomic backgrounds are similar. (Search your own school district in our interactive.)

10. Look for music everywhere on Saturday, International Jazz Day. And ABC will be broadcasting the star-filled concert that President and Michelle Obama are hosting Saturday night at the White House, featuring Aretha Franklin, Herbie Hancock, Al Jarreau, Sting, Dee Dee Bridgewater, Chick Corea, Pat Metheny and more. (Saturday, 8 p.m. Eastern)

_____

11. Finally, for fans of underdogs and soccer, there’s a historic match coming Sunday. Leicester City — pronounced Less-ter — started the season as a 5,000-to-1 shot, but could win England’s Premier League title with just one more improbable victory over a heavyweight rival, this time Manchester United. (9 a.m. Eastern, Telemundo and NBCSN)

Have a great weekend.
