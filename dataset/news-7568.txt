LONDON — The European tourism company TUI Group said on Thursday that it had agreed to sell Hotelbeds Group to the private equity firm Cinven and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board for 1.19 billion euros, or about $1.3 billion.

Hotelbeds, TUI’s wholesale hotel-room booking business, was not considered part of its core business and had been operated separately. It provides hotel bookings to travel agencies and tour operators in more than 120 countries.

In the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, Hotelbeds had revenue of €1.06 billion.

“This is a very successful transaction — a good deal for the future of Hotelbeds and for TUI Group shareholders as well as our continued growth in our core tourism business,” Friedrich Joussen, the TUI chief executive, said in a news release.

TUI said that it would use the proceeds from the sale for growth opportunities in its core business and to strengthen its balance sheet.

TUI’s business includes tour operators, travel agencies, airlines, hotels and cruise lines. The company employs about 76,000 people.

The transaction is subject to regulatory approval, and it is expected to be completed by the end of September.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank and the law firm Allen & Overy advised Tui on the transaction.
