Hard to believe, but itâ€™s been 10 years since the first episode of Inside The New York Times Book Review. Started in 2006 by Dwight Garner, the senior editor at the Book Review then and now a book critic for The Times, the show was hosted by Sam Tanenhaus, an editor of the Book Review, from its inception until 2013. In the very first episode, Tanenhaus spoke with the novelist Gary Shteyngart. Guests later in that first year would include Maurice Sendak, John Waters, Jennifer Egan, Vendela Vida, Dave Eggers and Lemony Snicket. And over the ensuding decade, the show would welcome John Updike, Toni Morrison, Donna Tartt and Keith Richards, among many others.

On this special episode of the podcast, Pamela Paul, the current editor of the Book Review and host of the podcast, talks to Tanenhaus, Garner and Shteyngart about the history of the show, favorite (and least favorite) guests and more.
