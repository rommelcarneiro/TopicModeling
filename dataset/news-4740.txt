As the New York Philharmonic fires the opening salvos in its new-music Biennial, other ensembles invite listeners to travel back in time with out-of-the-ordinary programs in out-of-the-way places. On Tuesday, May 24, the Salon Sanctuary series tunnels deep into the past with an evening of pre-modern West African chants and dances. The Liberian-born soprano Dawn Padmore leads a lineup of scholar-performers that includes the drummer Anicet Mundundu; the multi-instrumentalist Kevin Nathaniel Hylton; and the kora player Yacouba Sissoko, an heir to a notable family of storytellers from Mali. (Bernie Wohl Center in Manhattan, Salonsanctuary.org.) On Thursday, Midtown Concerts offers a refuge from the lunch-hour rush as the period-instrument string ensemble Acronym and the elegant baritone Jesse Blumberg perform cantatas by the 17th-century composer and hymn-smith Johann Rosenmüller.
