The veteran choreographer Lar Lubovitch has been commissioned by the Joyce Theater to conceive and direct “NY Quadrille,” a two-week tribute to 18th-century dance that will open the 2016-17 season.

For this festival, the Joyce will have a square platform stage built with seats on all sides. And, in keeping with the spirit of four, Mr. Lubovitch has tapped four choreographers — Pam Tanowitz, RoseAnne Spradlin, Tere O’Connor and Loni Landon — to create dances that will be performed four times each from Sept. 27 through Oct. 7.

Among other highlights in the coming Joyce season are the French choreographer Jérôme Bel’s Bessie award-winning work “The Show Must Go On” (2001) (part of the French Institute Alliance Française’s Crossing the Line Festival) in October; and Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company, which will perform two parts of “Analogy: A Trilogy,” inspired by oral histories collected by Mr. Jones, from Oct. 2 through Nov. 6.

In November, Michelle Dorrance brings back “The Blues Project,” which had its Joyce premiere in February 2015, before she was awarded the MacArthur “genius grant.” The work was created with Toshi Reagon and BIGLovely.

The season closes in February with the Martha Graham Dance Company, performing repertory works and presenting a new Sufism-inspired work by the choreographer Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui.
