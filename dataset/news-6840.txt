The frolicking didn’t end with the Met Gala. Hours after Anna Wintour’s annual coronation drew to a close, gussied-up peacocks with social media followers to stoke headed into the night’s after-parties.

Balmain hosted a soiree at the Gilded Lily in Chelsea, where the extended Kardashian clan wore different shades of Balmain as they posed for family portraits with the designer Olivier Rousteing.

Beyoncé arrived around 1 a.m. and sidled up next to Mr. Rousteing, sharing Champagne and laughs as camera phones snapped away.

Meanwhile, at nearby Up & Down, Naomi Campbell and the Weeknd hosted another Met Gala after-party. The packed and hazy room included Taylor Swift, Katy Perry, Justin Bieber and Madonna.

At 4 a.m., Lady Gaga got intimate with a fan who stuck out his tongue in a suggestive manner for a selfie video, which would end up on Twitter, Instagram and Vine.
