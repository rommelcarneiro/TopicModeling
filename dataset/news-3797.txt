Beatty Cynthia Cohan and James Semon Vrettos were married May 23 at their apartment in New York. Rabbi Michel Lerner officiated.

The bride, 67, is a psychotherapist and sex therapist in New York and East Hampton, N.Y. She is host of a weekly show, “Ask Beatty,” on the Progressive Radio Network. She graduated from the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg and received a master’s degree in social work from McGill University in Montreal.

The bride was a widow. Her first marriage ended in divorce. She is the daughter of the late Edith Sair and the late Maurice Sair, who lived in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

The groom, 69, is a sociologist and an adjunct professor of criminology at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. He is also the host of the weekly “The Radical Imagination,” a local cable show in New York. He graduated from the University of Colorado in Boulder and received a master’s degree in sociology from the New School and a Ph.D. in sociology from Columbia. His previous two marriages ended in divorce. He is a son of the late Luba Schiff and the late James S. Vrettos, who lived in New York.

The couple met in 1967 at the University of Colorado when Ms. Cohan was studying there for two semesters. They briefly dated the following year, but broke the relationship off. After having had no contact for more than four decades, they reconnected when Mr. Vrettos emailed Ms. Cohan in May 2013.
