Forty-five years ago, White House officials released the plan for Tricia Nixon’s June 12, 1971, wedding reception. The announcement included the recipe for her wedding cake, an old-fashioned lemon poundcake.

Then The New York Times tried to bake it. The result was “mush on the outside of the layer and soup on the inside,” wrote The Times’s food editor, Raymond A. Sokolov, in an article with the headline, “Warning! It May Not Work.”

Over the next days, former and future Times food staff members would weigh in on the recipe, which had been scaled down, perhaps problematically, for the home cook to yield a single, 12-inch round.

The White House chef at the time, Henry Haller, reportedly worked all night to fix the recipe. A food writer for The Washington Post found success baking the cake in a skillet. At The Washington Star, Marian Burros, a future Times food reporter, created a successful home version under Mr. Haller’s guidance.

Mr. Sokolov chronicled it all like a prize fight in a second article, “The Great Cake Controversy: Continued.”

The revised recipe called for extending the baking time and adding a paper collar to the pan. But it, too, failed in The Times’s test kitchen. The cake “shook like jelly but tasted like a very soft French lemon soufflé,” Mr. Sokolov wrote.

No matter. The more than seven-foot-tall tiered wedding cake was pronounced “elegant and edible” in the The Times’s coverage of Ms. Nixon’s wedding. Whether Heinz Bender, the pastry chef who baked the 350-pound cake amid the hoopla, altered the original recipe is not known. There was no mention of that in the article on the wedding that ran on Page 1, along with the paper’s first installment in what would become the Pulitzer Prize-winning series on the Pentagon Papers.
