Leicester City moved one victory from the Premier League title on Monday when the only team able to catch the Foxes in the championship race, second-place Tottenham, stumbled to a 1-1 tie against visiting West Bromwich Albion.

Leicester, a team transformed since it narrowly avoided relegation from the Premier League a year ago, can now clinch the crown by beating Manchester United on Sunday. But it will have to win at United’s famed stadium, Old Trafford, without its star striker Jamie Vardy.

Vardy, who missed Leicester’s last game while serving a red-card suspension, reportedly had his recent ban extended by a game on Monday. Vardy, who has 22 goals this season, faced an extended suspension because he verbally abused the referee who had ejected him from a match against West Ham on April 17.

With a 7-point lead over Tottenham with three games remaining, Leicester may not need him now. It needs only 3 points — a single victory — from its final three matches to clinch the title.

Craig Dawson helped Leicester’s cause on Monday; he denied Tottenham a victory with a 73rd-minute header after his own goal had given Spurs the lead in the first half.
