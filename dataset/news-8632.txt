PHILADELPHIA — The Mets received good news Tuesday when the starting pitcher Jacob deGrom threw well in a simulated game in Port St. Lucie, Fla., clearing the way for him to start against the Braves in Atlanta on Sunday.

DeGrom has been sidelined with a stiff back since his only start of the season, on April 8, when he gave up one run in six innings against the Philadelphia Phillies.

Compounding matters, deGrom and his wife have been dealing with a medical issue with their first child, a son, who was born last week. He has since been sent home.

Mets Manager Terry Collins said Monday he wanted to see how deGrom performed in the simulated game before deciding when deGrom would rejoin the team. DeGrom threw 71 pitches at the Mets’ spring training facility and appeared to have no issues with his back or handling the workload.

Collins said deGrom would start Sunday in place of Logan Verrett, who has pitched in two games while deGrom has been out. Verrett will make his second start of the season against the Phillies on Tuesday.

DeGrom will probably join the team Saturday, forcing the Mets to drop one player from their squad. Pitcher Rafael Montero or infielder Eric Campbell are the most likely candidates to be sent to the Mets’ Class AAA affiliate in Las Vegas.
