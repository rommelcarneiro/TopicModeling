For most Americans, it is hard to imagine not having easy access to the Internet. It is also hard to imagine how you would function in modern society without it.

Never mind not having your favorite food delivery and ride-hailing apps. Without broadband Internet access, you may have a hard time applying for a job, a driver’s license, financial aid or public assistance.

For residents of Detroit, which has the worst rate of Internet access of any big American city, that’s not unusual. Four out of 10 residents of the Motor City lack broadband.

As Cecilia Kang reports, Detroit has made some economic gains in recent years. Unemployment has declined from 19 percent three years ago to 11 percent, though that is still double the national average. But in some poor Detroit neighborhoods, the rate can be double the city’s average.

No doubt, poor Internet access adds to the challenge of changing that rate.
