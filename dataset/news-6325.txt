Here are the week’s top stories, and a look ahead.

1. Donald Trump shifted his focus to the general election after his last Republican rivals dropped out, accusing Hillary Clinton of enabling Bill Clinton’s philandering. Rebukes of Mr. Trump by top Republicans fueled fears that their party was on the verge of an epochal schism. On the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders prevailed in Indiana, reinvigorating his campaign, though he still lags in the delegate count. Mrs. Clinton has benefited most from a record surge in political donations by women this year.

2. Dry and windy conditions fed a devastating wildfire in western Canada. About 88,000 people evacuated Fort McMurray, Alberta, on Tuesday, but the spreading flames later forced rescue teams to airlift people out of temporary shelters. A disaster expert compared fighting the fire to “trying to stop a hurricane from hitting the Eastern Seaboard.” Our photographer managed to get to the town, a bustling center for the oil sands industry, and found large swaths reduced to ashes.

3. Sadiq Khan, a human rights lawyer and a member of the Labour Party, became one of the most prominent Muslim politicians in the West when he was elected mayor of London. He won by a wide margin as voters defied a rising tide of Islamaphobia and dismissed Conservative attempts to link him to extremism.

4. Scientists who tracked former competitors on “The Biggest Loser” as they regained weight — sometimes hundreds of pounds — found a key to dieting frustration. The body works overtime to regain lost pounds, shrinking its metabolic rate and losing a hormone that halts hunger. The story has drawn more than 2,500 comments from readers, many focused on fat shaming. “I have been dieting all of my life,” one wrote.

5. Prince had an undisclosed dependency on pain medication that may help explain his death at age 57. U.S. health regulators have been tightening guidelines on painkillers in light of a national epidemic of prescription drug abuse.

6. Many standard home appliances and devices devour power even when turned off. Here’s what our reporter found after testing about 30 appliances. You can lower your electric bill — and reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants — by plugging them into a power strip to turn off collectively. Using a gaming console to stream movies is particularly inefficient.

_____

7. Strikes and counterstrikes broke a partial truce aimed at temporarily halting catastrophic fighting in the divided Syrian city of Aleppo. Insurgents fired on government forces in the region, and loyalists then attacked a tent camp for people already displaced by the war, leaving rows of blackened tents and charred body parts. Activists put the death toll at more than 30.

8. One of the men pictured in this iconic World War II photograph may have been misidentified. James Bradley — who wrote the book “Flags of Our Fathers,” which became a Clint Eastwood film — said he believed his father, John Bradley, was involved in a different flag raising. The Marine Corps has opened an inquiry into the matter.

9. Nyquist, the favorite, won the Kentucky Derby. His 2:01.31 run beat the 2:03.02 Derby time of American Pharoah, the paragon that last year became the first Triple Crown winner in 37 years, but was well off the record set by Secretariat in 1973 of just under 2.00. The next leg for Nyquist is the Preakness on May 21. The last, the Belmont Stakes, comes June 11.

10. This is it for “The Good Wife.” Its seventh and final season is concluding tonight (9 p.m. Eastern, CBS). “Being herself — her selves — was work, and it was constant,” our reviewer wrote of the focal political wife, played by Julianna Margulies. “No wonder she kept so much red wine on hand.”

_____

11. Looking ahead: North Carolina is expected to miss a Monday deadline set by the Justice Department to suspend or repeal a law limiting bathroom access for transgender people. The state risks losing nearly $5 billion in federal aid for violating the Civil Rights Act. “We’re going to move at the speed that we’re going to move at to look at what our options are at this point,” the top Republican state representative said.

Have a great week.
