ISTANBUL — A female suicide bomber blew herself up near a historic mosque in the northwestern Turkish city of Bursa on Wednesday, wounding at least 13 people, officials said.

The explosion rocked the 14th-century Ulu Camii, or Grand Mosque, a popular tourist destination in a historic district of the city. Television reports showed shattered glass and debris from shops and restaurants close to the mosque. The police cordoned off the area as ambulances sped to the scene.

The Turkish health minister, Mehmet Muezzinoglu, said in a statement that none of the 13 people who were hospitalized were in critical condition.

The attack took place a few hours after the United States Embassy in Ankara issued a security advisory to American citizens, warning of credible threats against tourist destinations throughout Turkey.

The bombing is the latest in a series of terrorist attacks in metropolitan areas across the country this year, after the renewal of a bloody conflict between the Turkish state and Kurdish insurgents and the expansion of Turkey’s cooperation with the American-led coalition fighting the Islamic State in Syria.

Last month, a car filled with explosives blew up in a public square in the heart of Ankara, killing at least 35 people; Kurdish militants claimed responsibility. More recently, a suicide bomber struck Istanbul’s busiest street, killing at least four people, including two Americans. No group claimed responsibility, but the Turkish government said the Islamic State was to blame.
