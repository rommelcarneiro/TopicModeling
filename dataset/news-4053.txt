The F/A-18 Super Hornet jet fighters, based in Virginia Beach, crashed after an “in-flight mishap,” said Lt. Cmdr. Tiffani Walker, a spokeswoman for Naval Air Force Atlantic. Each of the planes costs at least $57 million, the Navy says. (AP)

The head of Chicago Public Schools said Thursday that the district had “reached the point of no return” and faced severe cuts without “equal” funding from the state. Forrest Claypool, the schools’ chief executive, led hundreds of people in a rally in Springfield seeking more state funds. The district faces a $1 billion deficit next school year. He has said that with only one week left in the legislature’s session, the district must “make a statement the governor cannot ignore.” The Democratic-led House passed and sent to the Senate a budget that includes money for public schools. But Gov. Bruce Rauner, a Republican, has indicated he will veto the bill if it passes. (AP)

The Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis on Thursday filed a bankruptcy reorganization plan that would set up a trust fund of more than $65 million to compensate some 440 clergy abuse victims plus other creditors, with just over half of that amount coming from insurance. The plan would also create a $500,000 fund to pay for counseling and incorporate the terms of a settlement reached with Ramsey County in December that allowed for greater legal oversight of the archdiocese. Archbishop Bernard Hebda said he believed the plan was fair, but knew some people might object and that it might need to be modified. Jeff Anderson, a lawyer for abuse victims, called the plan “predictably deficient.” (AP)
