SoftBank Group, the Japanese technology and telecommunications conglomerate, has lost its heir apparent, Nikesh Arora, who is quitting less than two years after he was hired and little more than 12 months after he was promoted to president.

Mr. Arora, a former Google executive, invested billions of the company’s money and was paid extravagantly as he staked a claim to take over from Masayoshi Son. The succession mess leaves SoftBank and its mercurial founder harder than ever to read.

This looks like another all-too-predictable case of a tycoon refusing to let go of the company he created. Mr. Son said he planned to step back next year when he turns 60, but recently decided to carry on for at least another five years and “work on a few more crazy ideas.”

With no prospect of taking over anytime soon, Mr. Arora — who received more than $200 million in compensation over the last two years — decided to move on. He will remain an adviser, and has sold the $500 million of SoftBank stock he bought last year to Mr. Son at a small loss.

Not all shareholders will be sorry to see him go. In a short period, Mr. Arora oversaw some bold bets, including a $1 billion stake in a Korean online retailer, Coupang, as well as the backing of the Indian e-commerce group Snapdeal and two Asian ride-hailing apps, Ola and Grab. On Monday, SoftBank’s board dismissed criticisms brought by unnamed investors accusing Mr. Arora of conflicts of interest and poor investment performance.

While it’s too soon to say whether the start-ups Mr. Arora championed will justify their valuations, SoftBank’s shake-up coincides with signs of financial restraint. It recently raised $10 billion by selling some shares in the Chinese online retailer Alibaba. At the same time it announced Mr. Arora’s departure, the $67 billion Japanese company offloaded its controlling stake in the games developer Supercell, maker of Clash of Clans, in a deal that values the company at $10.2 billion. The proceeds will reduce SoftBank’s debt and ease some of the strain caused by the troubled American wireless operator Sprint.

With SoftBank’s many disparate holdings and moving parts, investors can only be further confused by the big personnel change. The one thing they can be sure of for now is that once again their fate rests entirely in Mr. Son’s hands.
