Heat this imposing cast-iron pan on the grill, then fill it with oysters on the half shell topped with butter or pesto, and in five minutes they will be cooked to tender succulence. Try it with unshucked oysters, and in 10 minutes they will be open, warm and ready to serve. What the pan will not do is burnish the oysters to look like the photograph on the package; they will be delicious nonetheless. The pan also works for clams, shrimp, bacon-wrapped sea scallops and escargots for a crowd: Cast Iron Oyster Grill Pan, $39.95, Crate & Barrel, crateandbarrel.com.
