LONDON — The French oil and gas company Total said on Monday that it had agreed to acquire Saft in a deal that would value the high-technology battery maker at 950 million euros, or about $1.1 billion.

The deal is Total’s latest investment in renewable energy technology since the company agreed to pay $1.4 billion for a controlling stake in SunPower, an American solar energy firm, in 2011.

Under the terms of the deal, Total said it would pay €36.50 a share for Saft, representing a premium of 38.3 percent to its closing price on Friday.

Based in Bagnolet in the Paris suburbs, Saft is a designer and manufacturer of high-tech batteries for the manufacturing, transportation, and civilian and military electronics sectors. The company reported sales of €759 million in 2015 and employs more than 4,100 people in 19 countries.

“The combination of Saft and Total will enable Saft to become the group’s spearhead in electricity storage,” Patrick Pouyanné, the Total chairman and chief executive, said in a news release. “The acquisition of Saft is part of Total’s ambition to accelerate its development in the fields of renewable energy and electricity.”

Saft’s supervisory board has unanimously approved the takeover and said it intended to recommend that shareholders accept the offer.

“I am convinced that Total will provide Saft with the required expertise and resources needed for its future development, particularly in terms of technological and commercial capabilities,” said Ghislain Lescuyer, the Saft chief executive.
