The attention-grabbing news this week from a lawsuit between Penn State University and its insurer was the disclosure by the judge that the university’s former football coach, Joe Paterno, may have been told in 1976 that Jerry Sandusky, a longtime assistant coach, had molested a child.

Before the judge’s order was reported Thursday night, even Paterno’s harshest critics could not point to any evidence that the legendary Penn State coach had known about Sandusky’s widespread sexual abuse of minors before 1998 — 13 years before the scandal broke.

But the bigger news for Penn State may have been elsewhere in the opinion, where the judge, Gary Glazer of the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas, rejected the university’s argument that its insurer was obligated to cover all of the nearly $100 million in settlements the university has paid to 32 of Sandusky’s accusers.

Rather, Glazer concluded that instances of abuse after 1999 would be subject to trial. He found that the insurer would be responsible for paying settlements reached for instances of abuse before 1992. He also found that the insurer was not responsible for claims stemming from abuse between 1992 and 1999 — which accounted for many of the claims, according to Tom Kline, a lawyer for one victim who settled.

The ruling, on motions for a partial summary judgment, could have significant financial consequences for Penn State. The university may fail to recoup tens of millions of dollars in settlement funds it has already paid out — money that officials of the public university had previously insisted “will not be funded by student tuition, taxpayer funds or donations,” but rather by insurance.

“Penn State had depended during the litigation on the insurance coverage, so it’s a very significant setback for the university,” Kline said.

In his ruling this week, Glazer found that an exemption written into many of Penn State’s annual policies since 1992 eliminated the insurer’s obligations, particularly because Penn State apparently did not notify the insurer of the potential for claims in a timely fashion.

“By cloaking him with a title that enabled him to perpetrate his crimes,” wrote Glazer, referring to Sandusky, “P.S.U. must assume some responsibility for what he did both on and off campus.”

Or, as Kline put it: “Their failure to report what Paterno and others knew cost them millions in payments to the victims, and the same knowledge and failure to report cost them millions in insurance coverage.”

Penn State has already paid out the $92.8 million in settlements, according to Kline. It also paid a $60 million fine as part of a punishment levied by the N.C.A.A. and spent nearly $30 million more over two years on internal legal and investigative costs, according to a 2015 audit.

The revelation on Page 2 of the opinion that “in 1976, a child allegedly reported to P.S.U.’s Head Football Coach Joseph Paterno, that he (the child) was sexually molested by Sandusky” could upend the public understanding of the case. Until now, the widely (though not universally) accepted record has been that Paterno and other university officials were not aware of allegations against Sandusky until 1998 or 2001, after which time most, though not all, of Sandusky’s victims said they had already been abused.

“We note the court’s opinion states the alleged incidents are based upon the deposition testimony of persons who claim to have been victims of Jerry Sandusky,” Penn State said in a statement Friday. “We note these are allegations, and not established fact. The university has no records from the time to help evaluate the claims. More importantly, Coach Paterno is not here to defend himself.”

Paterno died in January 2012, only a few months after the Sandusky scandal came to light. Later that year, Sandusky, now 72, was convicted of sexually abusing 10 boys and was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison.

Paterno’s staunchest supporters have insisted that even the narrative that Paterno had been aware of an allegation against Sandusky in 1998 — the conclusion reached by the Freeh Report, a university-commissioned investigation which Penn State has since come to question — overstated Paterno’s knowledge regarding the man who had been his top defensive assistant for three decades.

In his ruling, Glazer also cited three other reports of molestation: one in 1987, witnessed by an assistant coach in a university facility; another in 1988, witnessed by a different assistant coach; and a third in 1988, which was referred to the athletic director.

Yet Glazer found that the annual policies before 1992 between Penn State and its insurer, Pennsylvania Manufacturers’ Association Insurance, did not appear to absolve the insurer from covering Sandusky-related claims.

A spokeswoman for the insurance company declined to comment Friday.

But Glazer found that between 1992 and 1999, a “specific Abuse or Molestation Exclusion” in Penn State’s annual policies meant that the insurance did not apply to the “negligent” employment or retention of an abuser such as Sandusky.

Moreover, an “ ‘expected or intended’ exclusion” in insurance policies beginning in 1998 suggested to Glazer that the insurer’s responsibility for claims stemming from those years is a subject for trial, because Gary C. Schultz, then a senior vice president, and Graham B. Spanier, then the Penn State president, having known of an allegation against Sandusky (according to the Freeh Report), should have understood the threat he posed.

“In 1998 and 2001,” wrote Glazer, “it was common knowledge, unfortunately, that sexual predators are repeat offenders.”

Glazer found that Schultz and Spanier “failed to take proper action” as Penn State’s “executive officers.”

Schultz and Spanier “should have contacted the authorities, obtained help for the children abused, and otherwise acted to prevent him from having future contact with children,” Glazer said, referring to Sandusky. “Instead, they apparently chose to sweep the problem under the rug.”
