David Berube was flying home to Connecticut in his single-engine plane on Tuesday when he called air traffic controllers for help. He was having difficulty maintaining control and experiencing problems with the instrument panel, officials said.

Then, officials said, the plane broke apart in midair over Long Island, killing Mr. Berube, 66, and his two passengers.

Mr. Berube, a businessman, had flown for decades, his brother Bruce Berube said. “Something terrible had to have happened,” he said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. “It’s not like he’s some new guy.”

Bruce Berube, who confirmed his brother’s death, said the passengers were his brother’s fiancée and a friend. They were returning from Myrtle Beach, S.C., where, Mr. Berube said, the youngest of David Berube’s three children, a son, had recently gotten married.

The authorities said on Wednesday that they had tentatively identified the three people — two men and a woman — aboard the plane but would not release their names because they were awaiting confirmation from a medical examiner.

At a news conference near the scene, officials from the National Transportation Safety Board said that investigators had not determined what caused the seven-passenger plane to break apart, but that there was no evidence of an explosion.

The authorities said on Wednesday that debris covered an area of roughly one-third of a mile, reducing the two-mile estimate given earlier. Investigators scoured yards and roadways for evidence. They found the nose, wings and tail, the “four corners” that are critical pieces of an accident investigation, said Robert Gretz, a senior air safety investigator for the safety board.
