Good evening. Here’s the latest.

1. The email issue that has shadowed Hillary Clinton’s presidential bid grew more damaging. The State Department’s inspector general sharply criticized her use of a private email server as secretary, and revealed that she did so to protect her personal information. The F.B.I.’s conclusions are still to come.

2. Mrs. Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump all campaigned in California, where primaries loom June 7. Security was tight at a Trump rally in Anaheim as the authorities sought to prevent a repeat of violent protests in New Mexico on Tuesday night, which Mr. Trump blamed on “criminals” carrying Mexican flags. Senator Elizabeth Warren intensified her criticism of Mr. Trump, zinging him as “a small, insecure, money grubber.”

3. Officials in 11 states sued the federal government for telling public schools to let transgender students use the restrooms of their choice. The suit, filed in Texas, said the Obama administration was trying to turn schools “into laboratories for a massive social experiment, flouting the democratic process, and running roughshod over common sense policies protecting children.” Above, the Nathan Hale School in Seattle. Washington was not among those suing.

4. It appears that Gawker’s founder, Nick Denton, was right. The financing for Hulk Hogan’s legal case against the gossip website did come from Silicon Valley. Specifically, the money came from Peter Thiel, above, the PayPal founder Gawker outed as gay in 2007. “It’s less about revenge and more about specific deterrence,” Mr. Thiel said in his first interview since his identity was revealed on Tuesday. Meanwhile, a judge denied Gawker a new trial over its publication of the Hogan sex tape, leaving a $140 million judgment in place.

5. Senior Taliban figures appointed a low-profile deputy of the leader killed in a U.S. drone strike to take overall command. But their choice, Mawlawi Haibatullah Akhundzada, above, has far more religious credentials than military experience. Some suspect he will focus on trying to quell raging factional dissent, while his ostensible deputy, the operations commander Sirajuddin Haqqani, will actually run the group.

____

6. Meanwhile, an Afghan Romeo and Juliet arrived in New York with their 17-month-old daughter, supported by the aid group Women for Afghan Women. The wife’s family had pursued them since they eloped, meaning to kill her for crossing religious and ethnic boundaries. “We submit to God — we tried everything here, but the situation did not change,” the nervous husband said before boarding the flight to the U.S. from Kabul.

____

7. Don’t expect airport security lines to shrink anytime soon, the head of the Transportation Security Administration told a disgruntled House Homeland Security Committee. Measures are being taken to ease the problem, but they won’t equal the increase in summer travel. “This is not a new rodeo,” the committee chairman complained. “Why didn’t we see this coming?”

____

8. New evidence bolsters the theory that Alzheimer’s develops from the brain’s attempt to fight off infection. Researchers say the plaques found in Alzheimer’s patients’ brains may be the remains of protein cages the brain used to trap microbes that managed to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. Above, amyloid plaques (green) trap salmonella bacteria (red).

9. If you needed reminding that people just need a good laugh: Candace Payne got a hero’s welcome at Facebook this week and is making the rounds of TV shows. All because of her delight in her birthday present to herself — a Chewbacca mask that makes the Wookiee’s distinctive growly whine. Her video been seen more than 140 million times since Friday, making it the most-watched Facebook Live video so far.

____

10. Finally, good news for national health. More and more people are putting out their cigarettes for good, leaving only around 15 percent of people over 18 puffing. Compare that to 25 percent about 20 years ago. A public health expert called the trend “remarkable,” and said federal campaigns and e-cigarettes might be helping.
