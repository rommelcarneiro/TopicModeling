“As simple as possible” is a central philosophy behind the Stockholm-based luxury outerwear brand Stutterheim, which opens its first stateside store this month. The hole-in-the-wall NoLIta shop, which was chiefly inspired by the brand’s newly-relocated flagship in the Sodermalm neighborhood of Stockholm, is starkly minimal. With steel fixtures, unvarnished hardwood floors and whitewashed brick walls, the space allows Stutterheim’s rows of colorful raincoats to be the focus. “We have worked long and hard to create context and circumstances for our collection to look as good as it can,” says Johan Loman, the brand’s co-founder and director of marketing.

Alexander Stutterheim — who founded the brand with Loman in 2010 — drew initial inspiration from a classic 1960s fisherman’s raincoat that belonged to his grandfather. (The raincoat has remained the brand’s signature style.) Since it launched, Stutterheim has built a steadfast following in both streetwear and high fashion worlds — and now offers two full unisex collections per year, as well as a permanent core collection. Following the hiring of a new head designer, Patric Wallertz, last year, the brand will introduce a wider range of materials and styles, like bonded cotton long coats and rain-resistant puffers, for fall/winter 2016.

Stutterheim has also recently broadened its range to include quilted vests and streamlined bomber jackets, as well as accessories. (One popular item is a rubberized cotton bucket hat that calls to mind a streetwise Paddington Bear.) While expansion proved necessary back home, they’re taking a modest approach when it comes to New York — at least to start. “It’s not like we’re opening up a perfect retail store,” says Loman. “But we’re learning as we go, and it’s going to be very exciting, for sure.”
