The Italians have arrived, and they’ll just keep dancing. For most of this week they’ll be seen onstage, onscreen and even offering improvised events before shows and during intermissions. All this is part of the second annual festival presented by Idaco nyc (the Italian Dance Connection), an organization that seeks to unite dancers from Italy with Italian dancers working independently in New York or as members of New York companies.

The cultural exchange includes works by 17 companies, many of them not well known here, and four film presentations. The schedule also includes four world premieres, their themes ranging from the plight of immigrants to tradition as a source of both tension and opportunity. (6 p.m., Tuesday, May 24, opening reception and performance, Italian Cultural Institute, Manhattan, free; 7:30 p.m., Wednesday through Friday, 5:30 and 7:30 p.m., Saturday; Sheen Center, sheencenter.org.)
