The kaleidoscopic, enigmatic music of the Danish composer Per Norgard, 83, has been seldom performed in America until recently being championed by the New York Philharmonic and others. This week, a three-day festival called Norgard in New York offers an ideal chance to discover the visceral music of this fascinating composer.

On Thursday, June 16, the program includes works influenced by Terry Riley, Philip Glass, Walt Whitman and Allen Ginsberg that Mr. Norgard wrote during a California residency in the 1970s. Lost Dog New Music Ensemble will perform pieces including the hypnotic “Spell,” which uses his Infinity Series compositional system. On Friday, the Momenta Quartet offers four of his 10 string quartets, including the haunting “Night Descending Like Smoke.” And on Saturday, Lost Dog returns with a program including the chamber symphony “Night-Symphonies, Day Breaks” and the striking “Nova Genitura,” with the soprano Sarah Moyer as soloist. (At 8 each night, Scandinavia House, Manhattan; 212-779-3587; norgardinnewyork.org.)
