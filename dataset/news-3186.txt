The Sarah Lawrence College Dance Program — which was led during its formative decades by Bessie Schönberg, for whom New York’s dance awards, the “Bessies,” are named — announced a new director this week: John Jasperse, the choreographer and dancer.

Mr. Jasperse, who graduated from Sarah Lawrence in 1985 and went on to form his own dance company, will succeed Sara Rudner, who has led the program since 1998 and plans to continue teaching, the college said. He will begin in the fall.

“The critical thinking that Sarah Lawrence nurtured in my time as a student has served me well, both in my practice as a dance artist and as a citizen,” Mr. Jasperse, whose company is now called John Jasperse Projects, said in a statement.

Ms. Rudner said in a statement that she was eager to work with Mr. Jasperse, describing him as “a master choreographer and teacher who has the skills and ‘smarts’ to enliven and enrich not only dance at our college, but to provide leadership in interdisciplinary pursuits.”

Mr. Jasperse, whose work has received two Bessie Awards, as well as a 2014 Doris Duke Artist Award, will present the premiere of his latest work, “Remains,” at the American Dance Festival in Durham, N.C., this July; it will be performed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music as part of its Next Wave Festival in September.
