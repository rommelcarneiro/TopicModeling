A police official has been reassigned and a detective has been fired amid an extensive federal inquiry into municipal corruption, the New York Police Department announced on Wednesday.

The police official, Inspector Peter DeBlasio, had been assigned to the Brooklyn South patrol borough and was transferred to an administrative position, Stephen P. Davis, the top police spokesman, said in a brief statement on Wednesday. Mr. Davis said that the department had also fired Detective Michael Milici, who was placed on a modified assignment on March 31.

Police officials said that neither man would testify before a grand jury.

In an email on Wednesday, Barry I. Slotnick, the lawyer representing Inspector DeBlasio, said, “We are opposing the demotion.” (The inspector is not related to Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat.)

Roy T. Richter, president of the Captains Endowment Association, said that Inspector DeBlasio, “cooperated fully and answered questions presented to him by federal investigators at his home in an early morning unscheduled interview.”

After his reassignment, Detective Milici filed for retirement and was suspended. Neither his lawyer nor the Detectives’ Endowment Association responded to phone and email messages seeking comment.

Detective Milici was called to testify before a grand jury, but refused, invoking his Fifth Amendment rights, police officials said. He faced departmental charges for his refusal to cooperate, which officers are required to do, police officials said.

In recent months, the Police Department has placed several senior officials on modified assignments. Two deputy chiefs have also been moved into less prestigious positions.

The investigation, led by the federal authorities and with the Police Department’s Internal Affairs Bureau, has centered on two businessmen with ties to Mayor de Blasio and their efforts to wield influence with police officials and others in the mayor’s administration.
