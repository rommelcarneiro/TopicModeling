A 34-year-old man from the Bronx was sentenced on Friday to 18 years in prison for fatally hitting his infant nephew in the head while he was watching the baby.

The man, Luis Cartagena, pleaded guilty last month in State Supreme Court in the Bronx to second-degree attempted murder for hitting the 2-month-old, Joemill Greer, on Oct. 27, 2014; Mr. Cartagena said he struck the child to stop him from crying.

He did not alert the authorities or the child’s mother that the boy had been gravely injured, prosecutors said. The child died four days later.

“The defendant didn’t even call 911,” Darcel D. Clark, the Bronx district attorney, said in a statement. “Now he will spend 18 years in prison for ending a life that had barely begun.”

Mr. Cartagena’s sentence also includes five years of supervision after he is released from prison. His lawyer declined to comment on Friday.

The authorities said that Joemill had sustained several blows to the head, and that Mr. Cartagena had claimed that the baby had been dropped or hit his head on a bedpost. Investigators found that Joemill had several fractures to his skull and was bleeding internally.
