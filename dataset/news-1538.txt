John Hickenlooper, the Democratic governor of Colorado whose name has been floated as a potential vice-presidential candidate for Hillary Clinton, strongly denounced Donald J. Trump for his response to the deadly attack in Orlando, Fla.

“We went through the same kind of thing,” Mr. Hickenlooper said in an interview this week, recalling the mass shooting in Aurora, Colo., in June 2012, in which 12 people were killed.

He said that he was struck by Mr. Trump’s instinct to turn the Orlando shootings of more than 100 people, nearly half of whom were killed, into an exercise in self-congratulation as opposed to one of empathy.

“His meanspirited response, and trying to seize the political opportunity,” Mr. Hickenlooper said of Mr. Trump, was unfair to “the injured victims and their family members.”

“He cared nothing for compassion, there was no sense of dignity, and those are the things that generally a community grieving finds nourishing,” Mr. Hickenlooper said.

Mr. Hickenlooper’s denouncement could serve to highlight for Mrs. Clinton’s team his instinct to battle the rival nominee, an important role that vice-presidential candidates play for the top of the ticket.

So far, the role of attacking Mr. Trump has been filled with relish by Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, who early on painted him as “dangerous” and “a fraud.”

Mr. Hickenlooper’s use of words did not rise to that level, but the governor said he believed that Mr. Trump had shown his true self this week.

“To a certain extent, people’s behavior in a campaign is generally a reflection of how they would act in office,” he said.
