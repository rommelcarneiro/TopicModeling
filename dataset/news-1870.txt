Theme parks in Orlando like Disney’s Magic Kingdom Park and Epcot, Universal Orlando and SeaWorld Orlando are being more vigilant following the shooting in the city early Sunday morning at Pulse nightclub that left 49 people dead.

In an email, a spokeswoman for Disney, Jacquee Wahler, wrote, “Unfortunately, we’ve all been living in a world of uncertainty, and during this time we have increased our security measures across our properties, adding such visible safeguards as magnetometers [metal detectors], additional canine units, and law enforcement officers on site, as well as less visible systems that employ state-of-the-art security technologies.”

Few of the representatives for the other parks were willing to comment on any specific security measures being implemented following the catastrophe over the weekend, but a handful did say that they were being more vigilant.

In an email, a SeaWorld spokeswoman, Suzanne Pelisson Beasley, said: “The safety of our ambassadors, guests and animals has always been our top priority. Our security teams work closely with law enforcement and we have enhanced security measures at all our parks.”

Also, a Universal Orlando spokesman, Tom Schroder, said that guest safety is the park’s top priority, but that the company doesn’t discuss security plans and procedures.

Although the theme parks may be more hesitant to share specifics on extra security measures since the weekend, many, including Universal, SeaWorld and the four Walt Disney World theme parks, started giving security increased attention last December by adding metal detectors at entryways.

Legoland, a Lego-themed park in Winter Haven, Fla., about 45 minutes from Orlando, added metal-detecting wands and also began searching guests’ bags before they entered.

A Legoland spokesman, David Brady, said that the new measures went into place to prepare for the heavy attendance expected during the December holiday season.

Orlando is one of the top tourist destinations in the United States and continues to grow in popularity, according to statistics from VisitOrlando, the city’s official tourism association. In the last week of January, occupancy rates in the city were up 18 percent over 2015. Also, 66.1 million people visited Orlando in 2015, making it the most visited destination in the United States.
