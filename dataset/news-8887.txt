The director J.J. Abrams dropped a possible hint Friday evening about the next “Star Wars” and who the protagonist Rey’s parents might be — and who they weren’t.

Played by Daisy Ridley, Rey, whose storyline formed the backbone of “The Force Awakens,” is revealed to be strong with the Force, causing widespread speculation that Luke Skywalker, whom she meets at the film’s end, might be her father.

Asked by a Tribeca audience member who Rey’s parents were, J. J. Abrams responded, “Rey’s parents are not in Episode VII,” which could be interpreted to mean that Luke Skywalker is not Rey’s father, as many suspected.

Mr. Abrams’s response was part of a wide-ranging conversation with Chris Rock, but he revealed nothing else on Friday night, adding only, “It is something that Rey thinks about, too.”

Mr Abrams later backtracked somewhat to Entertainment Weekly, saying, “What I meant was that she doesn’t discover them in Episode VII. Not that they may not already be in her world,” he said.

A spokesman for Disney, which plans to release Episode VIII in 2017, had no comment.
