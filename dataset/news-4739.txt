Danny Rayburn is dead, but he’s not buried. That’s great news for the Ben Mendelsohn fans who were worried that the most heartbreakingly divisive character on Netflix’s “Bloodline” would vanish with the Florida Keys’ changing tides after his younger brother killed him.

Season 2, streaming Friday, May 27, finds Danny haunting the Rayburns’ dreams: not just those of his protector turned murderer, John (Kyle Chandler), brazenly campaigning for county sheriff, but also their siblings, the duplicitous Meg (Linda Cardellini), recently ascended to a New York law firm, and the perpetually buzzed Kevin (Norbert Leo Butz), now the master of his own boatyard. And Sally (Sissy Spacek), the matriarch of this dysfunctional clan, is just beginning to fathom what lurks beneath its picture-postcard veneer. There are new folks in town — Danny’s secret son, Nolan (Owen Teague); his mother, Evangeline (Andrea Riseborough); and the unsavory Ozzy Delvecchio (John Leguizamo) — and they’ve been telling her things.
