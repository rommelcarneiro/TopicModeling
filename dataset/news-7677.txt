Curious about what the life of the National Security Agency whistle-blower Edward J. Snowden looks like? Joseph Gordon-Levitt and the director Oliver Stone turn it into a wild ride in the new trailer for “Snowden.” Mr. Gordon-Levitt, dropping the French accent he used to play the high-wire artist Philippe Petit, now meets another vocal challenge, lowering his voice and tempering his cadence to mimic Mr. Snowden’s speech.

The trailer gives some quick back story and offers a long look at the film’s increasingly heightened narrative. We first see Mr. Snowden training in the Army Reserves, and hear him being discharged because of an injury. Next, in an interview, he is asked why he wants to be a part of the Central Intelligence Agency. His response: “I’d like to help my country make a difference in the world.”

We see him revered for his technical skills, tell his girlfriend (played by Shailene Woodley) about his new job at the National Security Agency, and then see his discovery of just how much information the government can access about the public. In one shot, he smuggles out secret data in a Rubik’s cube, and, as the score and edits get more intense, he realizes just how risky his decisions are. As the trailer puts it, “Run, hide, live to tell the truth.”

In two and a half minutes, Mr. Snowden’s story turned into a life-or-death thriller. But would Mr. Stone have it any other way? “Snowden” is set for release on Sept. 16.
