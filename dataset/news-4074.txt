“American Psycho,” the new Broadway musical based on Bret Easton Ellis’s controversial 1991 novel about a murderous banker in 1980s Manhattan, will close on Sunday, June 5, the producers announced on Thursday.

The show, adapted by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa (book) and Duncan Sheik (songs), opened in April at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theater to mixed reviews. In The New York Times, Ben Brantley praised elements of the design, but over all called it “a mess” in which “conflicts of intention cancel one another out, leaving you numb.”

The show struggled to gain traction at the box office since it opened. Last week it took in $565,107, or about 53 percent of its potential gross. Earlier this month it received just two Tony Award nominations, for best scenic design (Es Devlin and Finn Ross) and best lighting (Justin Townsend).

The show had its premiere in London in 2013. It was to have its New York premiere in February 2014 at Second Stage Theater, a nonprofit Off Broadway company, but that fall the rights were pulled by the company that had been developing it for years.

When it closes, “American Psycho” will have played a total of 81 performances.
