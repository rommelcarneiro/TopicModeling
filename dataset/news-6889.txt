Miami’s Goran Dragic scored 26 points and Dwyane Wade had 7 of his 24 in overtime after a halfcourt shot by Toronto’s Kyle Lowry’s tied the score at the buzzer, and the Heat beat the host Raptors, 102-96, on Tuesday night in Game 1 of their Eastern Conference semifinal series.

Joe Johnson scored 16 points and Josh Richardson 11. Hassan Whiteside had 17 rebounds for the Heat.

Game 2 is Thursday night in Toronto.

Lowry’s improbable 3-pointer from his own side of the halfcourt line capped Toronto’s 6-point comeback in the final 20 seconds of regulation, but the Raptors could not deliver in the extra session. Toronto went scoreless for the first 3 minutes 46 seconds of overtime before DeMar DeRozan hit a jumper.

VAREJAO DENIES INTENT Golden State’s backup big man, Anderson Varejao, said he did not deliberately trip Trail Blazers guard Gerald Henderson in Game 1 of their Western Conference semifinal playoff series.

Portland Coach Terry Stotts called it a “dirty play” on Monday. On Tuesday, the N.B.A. ruled it a Flagrant 1 foul on Varejao.

Varejao, 33, a 12-year veteran, said, “I would never try to hurt anybody; I would never do that.”

BATTLE FOR ATTENTION Despite getting more attention from Canadian television viewers, the Toronto Raptors are still struggling to compete with hockey and baseball.

The Canadian sports network Sportsnet said that the Raptors’ first-round Game 7 win over the Indiana Pacers had an average audience of 1.53 million viewers Sunday night, making it the most-watched Raptors game ever in Canada.

Still, the Raptors were outdrawn by Saturday’s N.H.L. draft lottery, which pulled in an average of 1.57 million viewers.

Meanwhile, the network said the second round of the N.H.L. playoff series between the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Washington Capitals averaged 1.5 million viewers, while a regular-season baseball game between the Toronto Blue Jays and Tampa Bay Rays on Saturday attracted an average of 1.1 million viewers.
