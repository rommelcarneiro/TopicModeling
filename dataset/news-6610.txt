Stephen Curry is unlikely to play for the Golden State Warriors on Saturday in Game 3 of the Western Conference semifinals at Portland, as he has not yet practiced on his sprained right knee.

While the Warriors practiced Thursday, Curry did work on the side.

He did not participate in any scrimmaging, which the medical staff and coaches want to see before he is cleared to return.

“He’s gotten better and better each day,” Coach Steve Kerr said. But when asked whether Curry would play on Saturday, Kerr replied, “probably not.”

Game 4 on Monday is still a possibility if Curry keeps making progress.

“Everything has gone very smoothly,” Kerr said. “He hasn’t had any setbacks. He’s ramping up things in the weight room.”

The Warriors will practice again in Oakland on Friday before flying to Portland in the afternoon. Kerr said that even on a game day, when the team has only a shootaround, Curry could work two-on-two with assistant coaches.

Golden State, the defending champion, leads the best-of-seven series against the Trail Blazers, two games to none.
