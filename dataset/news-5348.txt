August Wilson wrote 10 plays for his famed American Century Cycle, and nine of them have been staged on Broadway.

Now the Manhattan Theater Club says it plans to make it 10 out of 10: the nonprofit said it would bring “Jitney” to Broadway this winter.

The play, which Mr. Wilson wrote in 1979, is about a group of men who drive unlicensed cabs in Pittsburgh. It has had multiple productions, including Off Broadway at Second Stage and the Union Square Theater, as well as in London.

The Manhattan Theater Club said its Broadway production would begin previews on Dec. 28 and open on Jan. 19 at the company’s Samuel J. Friedman Theater. The production will be directed by Ruben Santiago-Hudson, a frequent Wilson interpreter who won a Tony Award for his performance in Wilson’s “Seven Guitars.” Casting has not yet been announced.

MTC also said Monday that it would present a play called “Cost of Living,” written by Martyna Majok (“Ironbound”) and directed by Jo Bonney, at City Center next spring. That play is having its premiere this summer at Williamstown Theater Festival, which will co-present the Off Broadway production as well.
