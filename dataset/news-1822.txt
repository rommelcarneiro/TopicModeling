A reader asks: An obit for the woman who invented the beehive hairdo? How did that come about?

Bruce Weber, the Times reporter who penned it, responds.

Margaret Vinci Heldt was a natural subject for a Times obituary; she created something that affected the culture and carved out a place for itself in social history — just about a texbook definition for changing the world, no? As for how it came about, I can’t say that we keep an eye on famous hairdressers who have lived beyond their prime, and I’m afraid we can’t claim, in this instance anyway, to have mined any secret resources to learn of Ms. Heldt’s death. She was a Chicagoan; The Chicago Sun-Times published her obituary, which is where we in the department read about it. (The Associated Press also ran a brief item.) I will note that the editors were going to give the obit to another writer because, as one of them said to me, “It isn’t exactly in your wheelhouse,” but then I reminded him that four years ago I had written the obituary of Vidal Sassoon — on deadline.

One famous beehive left unrecognized in the obit was perhaps the tallest one of all: Marge Simpson’s.

And the B-52’s, the new-wave rock band whose members wore the style, posted our obit of Ms. Heldt on their Facebook page, with the message: “Whatever would we have done without her? #ourhero #ournamesake.” Oddly enough, some people refer to the beehive as the B-52, ostensibly because its shape is similar to that of the nose of a B-52 bomber aircraft.
