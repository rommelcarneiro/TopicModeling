I treasure my Japanese nakiri knife. The blade is rectangular, making it like a cross between a chef’s knife and a light cleaver, and thinner than a standard chef’s knife, all the better for juliennes. And it efficiently scoops up whatever you have cut. The knife is designed for vegetables, and in summer, with fresh zucchini, cucumbers, tomatoes, peppers and herbs, it’s a must-have for slicing, peeling and chopping. Wüsthof, the German knifemaker, has introduced hollow-edge nakiris in two sizes: 5-inch with the standard classic handle, and 7-inch in three styles: classic, gourmet and a curved-handle version called classic ikon (shown): Wüsthof nakiri knives, $79.95 to $159.95, cutleryandmore.com.
