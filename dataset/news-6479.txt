Craig asks: My wife calls me every day on her commute home with the expectation that I will chat with her for the duration of her drive. I am effectively her personal podcast. She says she wants to hear my voice. This is false. She is bored and wants to be entertained. Please make it stop.

I am so sorry that your wife wants to speak to you! But this sentence exists in a quantum state of sarcasm and sincerity. You’re clearly a monster, but you’re also right: Phone calls are terrible, anxious messes of misunderstandings, dropouts and dull patches. That’s why the phone is only for 911 and hands-free time-wasters like your wife. You must grant your wife a 10-minute postwork call for venting. Thereafter, encourage her to listen to the personal podcast that I order you to record for her every day.
