MADRID — In a newly installed corridor of champions at the Madrid Open, action-shot paintings of recent winners adorn the walls. As might be expected at a clay-court event, earth tones dominate the palette — except in the images of Serena Williams and Roger Federer from 2012, which many players hope will remain a one-time aberration.

That year, tournament organizers changed the color of the clay courts from the traditional reddish orange to a vivid cerulean, seeking a unique brand identity and a better contrast on television with the yellow ball.

After top players complained about the clay’s slipperiness and its dissimilarity with other courts, the blue clay was gone the next year, and the novelty surface is now believed to be extinct worldwide.

Rafael Nadal, the dominant presence in Spanish tennis for more than a decade, had complained most forcefully of all. Speaking at the tournament last week, Nadal continued to criticize the choice to go blue.

“For sure, that was a bad decision in that moment,” Nadal said.

Nadal, who has dominated red clay events around Europe, disliked the change even before he set foot on the blue surface and has maintained his traditionalism and his desire to preserve his preferred surface.

“I believe that the clay is red,” he said. “We don’t have 100 tournaments on clay per year. The clay is part of the history of our sport.”

Comparing it to the sport’s other organic surface, he said, “I don’t see red grass, so I don’t like blue clay.”

Ion Tiriac, the Romanian tennis mogul who owns the Madrid tournament, chose blue hardcourts for television purposes when the tournament was in Stuttgart, Germany.

As blue became the color of choice across the tour — the United States Open changed to blue in 2005, and the Australian Open followed suit in 2008 — Tiriac wanted, he said, “to make the sport more interesting on the screen” and saw no reason not to try blue clay at his tournament, which had shifted to outdoor clay in 2009.

“It was not a stupid thing,” Tiriac said last week.

José Miguel García, chief of competition and player services for the Madrid Open, said that the blue clay had the same earthen origins as standard clay but that iron oxide was removed from the excavated earth to change its color from red to white before it was then baked into bricks. The white bricks were ground into powder, and the blue pigment was added.

Nadal and other top players on the ATP Players’ Council, including Novak Djokovic and Federer, objected to the switch when it was first proposed.

Although ATP player representatives opposed the change unanimously, tournament representatives and the chief executive at the time, Adam Helfant, narrowly pushed through its eventual approval.

Eric Butorac, who now serves as president of the council, said the players’ skepticism had quickly been validated.

“Players weren’t happy that it went through in the first place, and then they went there with a critical eye,” Butorac said, adding that the surface had been so slippery that it was “borderline unplayable.”

“Novak and Rafa were the top two who were ready to hate it, and then it lived up to every expectation from those two,” Butorac said of Djokovic and Nadal.

Tiriac suggested that those two players found particular reason to complain because they ultimately lost on the blue clay to lower-ranked players from their own countries.

García said the criticism of the blue clay was rooted in the same complaints that had dogged the tournament’s surface in the three previous years, when it was red. Players had complained from the inaugural year at the site in 2009 that the court was soft and uneven because of poorly installed drainage systems.

The blue clay, García said, suffered from the same poor underlying construction that had affected the red clay courts in previous years. Additionally, a combination of heavy rain followed by a heat wave baked the clay base into a surface that was harder than it should have been. Players were unable to control their sliding on a powdery surface that García compared to marbles on a concrete floor.

Despite the slick conditions, no players were injured during the week, and the television aesthetics behind the innovation were validated: The yellow ball was easier to track than at any clay court tournament before.

The surface also matched the futuristic design at the tournament site, called the Magic Box, which is covered in metallic paneling.

Still, Nadal and Djokovic said they would not return to the tournament if the clay remained blue.

García said everyone at the tournament had been disappointed by the reception of the tournament, which forced them to revert to red the next year.

“For me, it was a risk because it was my responsibility, and I was very damaged by all of this,” he said. “But O.K. And then for the tournament, the decision was that we have to do the best courts in the world.”

The clay, red again, has improved.

“The real thing is, after that year, here in Madrid the courts are fantastic,” Nadal said, calling them some of the best in the world.

The women’s semifinalist Samantha Stosur said Madrid’s clay now ranked among the world’s best, and she saw no reason to try another color experiment.

“Don’t mess with something that’s good, I think,” Stosur said.

Tiriac, though, remains restless, and he said he would reinstall the blue court “yesterday” if he could, for the same reasons of visual contrast that drove his original experiment.

“I don’t see the ball here,” he said, gesturing toward a red court. “I’m old, and I wear glasses.”

Djokovic said last week that he applauded Tiriac’s “creative spirit.”

Saying that he thought the sport’s history should generally be respected, Djokovic added: “But having the kind of mind-set of innovation and evolution, I salute. I think that it’s the right way. Everything is moving forward. Tennis should, too.”

Butorac said there could be renewed willingness to experiment in the next generation of players, after those who experienced the blue misfire had aged out of the game.

“I think we need to continue to push forward,” he said. “A guy like Tiriac, while some think he’s a little crazy, he is a bit of a visionary. Having some guys who think like this is great for the sport. I hope it doesn’t deter people from trying more things like this in the future.”

García said that he was confident he would be able to incorporate blue clay perfectly with the lessons learned from the 2012 attempt and that he hoped the surface would be given another chance, perhaps at a smaller tournament that would not be subject to the strong wills of star players.

“For me, I’m very proud of it because I think it was something very impressive,” García said of the blue clay. “It was tough, very tough, to deal with the situation during the tournament. I am sad that we couldn’t get the court in good shape for the players, but I hope that we can do it again in the future.”
