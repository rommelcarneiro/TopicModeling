Historically, Hollywood has denied screenwriters their proper due, which the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences tries to rectify with “Spotlight on Screenwriting,” a series at Film Forum and the SVA Theater. It runs Sunday, May 15, and Monday, with “Hollywood’s Happiest Couple,” a program honoring the team of Billy Wilder (1906-2002) and Charles Brackett (1892-1969).

Wit was their signature, as in Ernst Lubitsch’s “Ninotchka” (1939) and Wilder’s “Sunset Boulevard” (1950), both featured. But they could be topically two-fisted, as in Wilder’s unsparing portrait of alcoholism, “The Lost Weekend” (1945). An Oscar-winning Ray Milland, abetted by gritty Manhattan locations, portrays a failed writer in desperate pursuit of “one little jigger of dreams.” It’s all here: the hidden bottles, the self-loathing, the DT’s — and the self-deception. “I’m one of the great ones,” he drunkenly proclaims. “I’m John Barrymore before the movies got him by the throat.” Bottoms up.
