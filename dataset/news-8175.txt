Lampshades are not meant to be worn as head gear, but when a contemporary fashion designer like Katie Eary creates for the home, anything goes.

And if you’re searching for interesting wedding gifts, or presents for Mother’s Day, you might find just the right thing at Ikea.

This week the Swedish retailer is presenting a new collection of tableware and bedding, called Giltig, created by Ms. Eary, the London based designer, whose clothing is also very unusual.

This collection is the first collaboration in a series planned between Ikea and fashion designers.
