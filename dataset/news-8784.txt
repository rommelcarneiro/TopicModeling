Energy companies led a broad rally in United States stocks on Monday as investors shrugged off another slide in crude oil prices.

The gain nudged the Dow Jones industrial average above the 18,000-point mark for the first time since last summer, while the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose to the highest level in a year.

The market headed lower early on, after news that representatives from several major oil-producing nations meeting over the weekend in Doha, Qatar, had failed to reach a deal to cut output. That sent the price of United States oil down 7 percent at one point before recouping much of its losses. It ended down 1.4 percent.

Beyond the volatile oil market, investors had their eye on the latest company earnings, which have been mostly encouraging so far, said Sean Lynch, co-head of global equity strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.

“We’re seeing broad-based gains across all the sectors,” Mr. Lynch said. “The market is maybe finding some resilience here and maybe looking back on the fundamentals of the earnings season and seeing it’s not so bad.”

The Dow climbed 106.70 points, or 0.6 percent, to 18,004.16. The last time the average was above 18,000 points was on July 20.

The S.&P. 500 index added 13.61 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,094.34.

The Nasdaq composite index gained 21.80 points, or 0.4 percent, to 4,960.02.

For the year, the Dow is up 3.4 percent, while the S.&P. 500 is up 2.4 percent. The Nasdaq is down about 1 percent.

Several energy and drilling services companies rebounded after an early morning sell-off.

Hess shares rose $2.67, or 4.7 percent, to $59.84, while stock in Marathon Oil added 35 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $13.36. Baker Hughes shares gained $1.90, or 4.3 percent, to $45.70.

Energy companies had the biggest gain among the sectors in the S.&P. 500, rising 1.6 percent. The sector is up 7.7 percent this year.

All told, domestic crude fell 58 cents, or 1.4 percent, to settle at $39.78 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international benchmark, lost 19 cents, or 0.4 percent, to 42.91 a barrel in London.

Stocks in the health care and consumer discretionary sectors also posted big gains. Stock in Hasbro jumped 5.8 percent after the company reported results that topped forecasts. The toy company benefited from strong sales of “Star Wars,” “Frozen” and Disney princess products.

The toy company earned $48.8 million, or 38 cents a share, for the period that ended March 27. That compares with a profit of $26.7 million, or 21 cents a share, a year earlier. Hasbro shares added $4.77 to $87.18.

Endo International led a surge among several pharmaceutical companies. The stock also posted the biggest gain in the S.&P. 500, vaulting $2.16, or 8.2 percent, to $28.49. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals climbed $15.65, or 3.9 percent, to $422.38.

Morgan Stanley’s first-quarter profit fell 54 percent from a year ago, hurt by weak performance at its trading and investment banking units. But its results still beat Wall Street expectations. Shares of Morgan Stanley slipped 3 cents to close at $25.73.

PepsiCo’s chief, Indra Nooyi, said on Monday that the company was reshaping its product lineup to better reflect the growing interest in healthy eating. The company gets less than 25 percent of its global sales from soda, Ms. Nooyi said. Shares of Pepsi slipped 0.05 percent.

Major stock indexes in Europe also closed higher. Germany’s DAX rose 0.7 percent, while the CAC-40 in France edged up 0.3 percent. Britain’s FTSE 100 index was up 0.2 percent.

In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 index dropped 3.4 percent as a rising yen and earthquake-related production halts added to investor worries. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index lost 0.7 percent.

In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline fell about 2 cents to $1.44 a gallon. Heating oil was little changed at $1.24 a gallon. Natural gas rose 38 cents, or 2 percent, to $1.94 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Precious and industrial metals futures ended narrowly mixed. Gold edged up 40 cents to $1,235 an ounce, silver slipped six cents to $16.25 an ounce, and copper edged up a penny to $2.16 a pound.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.77 percent from 1.75 late Friday. The dollar rose to 108.79 yen from 108.70 yen. The euro rose to $1.1306 from $1.1283.
