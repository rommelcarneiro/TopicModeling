PASADENA, Calif. — James Rodriguez scored a goal and set up another in the first 30 minutes, and Colombia clinched a berth in the Copa América quarterfinals with a 2-1 victory over Paraguay on Tuesday night.

Colombia became the first team to secure advancement to the knockout stage of the tournament with stellar goaltending from David Ospina and another dynamic performance from Rodriguez, who shook off a shoulder injury that made his availability a game-time decision at the Rose Bowl.

Rodriguez, a Real Madrid midfielder, propelled Colombia to its second win in two matches, following a 2-0 victory over the United States last week.

Victor Ayala scored Paraguay’s first goal of the Copa América in the 71st minute on a long shot past Ospina, who made a handful of jaw-dropping saves to keep Colombia ahead.
