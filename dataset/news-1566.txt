Senator Harry Reid and Senator Mitch McConnell often have unkind things to say about each other’s Senate leadership skills. But Mr. Reid, the Democratic minority leader from Nevada, says he is becoming increasingly impressed by Mr. McConnell’s skills of persuasion as the majority leader. Sort of impressed, anyway.

In an interview, Mr. Reid said he doubted he could have ever persuaded his fellow Democrats to go on a “fool’s errand” such as stonewalling the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland, refusing to schedule hearings and in multiple cases deciding against even a courtesy meeting with the nominee.

“If anybody can get his senators to all agree to go over a cliff and kill themselves, that’s pretty good,” Mr. Reid said in his deadpan manner. “Boy, I will tell you that guy has a lot more sway with his caucus than I ever had. If I ever suggested something as absurd and bizarre as that to my caucus, they would revote and kick the hell out of me out of the caucus. I mean, really.”

Mr. Reid added that he believed the Republican refusal to take up the Garland nomination has already put Democratic contenders ahead in some Senate races.

Mr. McConnell, in his new book, “The Long Game,” did acknowledge that Mr. Reid can be “thoughtful, friendly and funny.”

“But as soon as the cameras turn on or he’s offered a microphone,” Mr. McConnell wrote, “he becomes bombastic and unreasonable, spouting things that are both nasty and often untrue, forcing him to later apologize.”

But it is doubtful that Mr. Reid will want to apologize in this case for complimenting Mr. McConnell’s abilities. Sort of.
