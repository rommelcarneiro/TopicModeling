The theme of the exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute this year was fashion in an age of technology. This meant that people like Andrew Bolton, the institute’s new head curator, along with Jonathan Ive of Apple — who served as a sponsor — spoke in lofty tones about the dichotomies of man versus machine, haute couture versus ready-to-wear, hand-sewn versus mass produced.

For lay people, it meant a carefully curated exhibit of wild designer gowns and a gala celebration on Monday night at which the bulk of celebrity attendees wore metallics.

Kanye West wore a loosefitting metallic jacket and a pair of colored contact lenses that turned his eyes a kind of iridescent blue. His wife, Kim Kardashian, wore metallic, beaded Balmain.

The stylist Tabitha Simmons wore red and gold embroidered Dolce & Gabbana, looking rather like a chair in pre-revolutionary France.
