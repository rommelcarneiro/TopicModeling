Dear Facebook addicts: You are a great benefit to Mark Zuckerberg and his growing Facebook empire.

When the social media giant announced the results for its most recent quarter, Wall Street analysts were reasonably impressed by its jump in both total revenue and profitability.

But as James Stewart points out in his column, the number that is truly eye-popping is 50. That’s the amount of time the company says users spend on its Facebook, Instagram and Messenger platforms. That number doesn’t include the messaging app WhatsApp.

Time spent on Facebook platforms has gone up by 10 minutes over the last two years. And it’s just about 10 minutes less time than people spend eating and drinking every day, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

In other words, time spent on Facebook is catching up with time spent seeking basic sustenance.

The analysis firm comScore puts daily Facebook use at a more modest 35 minutes. But that’s still twice the time comScore believes people spend on YouTube; almost four times the amount of time they spend on all of Yahoo’s sites, and 35 times the amount of time people spent on Twitter.

No doubt, Facebook has done a remarkable job of finding new ways to keep people on the site, from more relevant newsfeeds to trending topics to video. But if it’s nice out, you could still consider going for a walk, since on average people spend about 17 minutes a day getting exercise.
