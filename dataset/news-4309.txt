A senior officer in the Brussels police, Pierre Vandersmissen, was hospitalized on Tuesday after a protester smashed him in the head with a stone when an anti-austerity protest became violent, according to a video of the event and local news reports.

After being hit, Commissioner Vandersmissen, who was not wearing protective riot gear, was seen lying in the street on his face, seemingly unconscious.

Before, he had been chasing protesters with a canister of pepper spray.

He is expected to be discharged from the hospital on Wednesday, according to news reports.

Once on the ground he was surrounded by protesters until a civilian in a gray, hooded sweatshirt first came to his aid. Then officers in body armor, carrying shields and batons, arrived to help.

One demonstrator near Commissioner Vandersmissen was apparently struck by the police and was seen bleeding from his head.

Two police officers and eight protesters were injured in the clashes, according to The Associated Press.

The protests were called by labor unions to demonstrate against the center-right government’s plans to cut social welfare programs.

In a statement, the government said that it “condemns the violence committed by a minority.”
