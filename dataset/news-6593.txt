Let’s check out some fun shows this weekend. I’ve seen an awful lot of severe beatings on TV in the last few weeks — the cost of watching dramas, I guess, though if I never see someone spit out a tooth again, that would be O.K. I had to balance it out with some lighter fare, and I turned to my go-to comfort genre: The skill-oriented reality contest show.

“Project Runway All Stars” ended Thursday night (but you can watch it on Lifetime), so I’m left with my obsession, SpikeTV’s “Ink Master,” which is basically “Top Chef” for tattooing. If there was ever a case for a show to watch with your finger on the fast-forward button, this is it. I’m allergic to all that fake infighting that is so common on reality shows, and unfortunately “Ink Master” tends to be two-thirds that. But the one-third that’s actual artistic talent and thoughtful, educational judging? Compelling TV!

That’s also the best way to watch Amazon’s “The Fashion Fund,” about the finalists for the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund for emerging designers. All the presentations and feedback sessions are great — and all the talking-head dithering is a snooze.

This Sunday is Mother’s Day, and I have a few suggestions for what you can watch with your mom. “The Good Wife” is coming to an end, but “Wallander” is back. The TV gods giveth, and the TV gods taketh away. Have a great weekend.

... punchy dramedies and great costumes: Try “Miss Fisher’s Murder Mysteries.” It’s an Australian import set in the 1920s, and our heroine is Phryne Fisher (Essie Davis), a glamorous and brilliant detective with a bob haircut to die for. She solves a lot of scandalous murders, and she wears a lot of incredible hats. The dream! (Watch on Netflix)

... super trashy TV movies: Of course LMN (that’s Lifetime Movie Network) has a Mother’s Day marathon of glorious schlock. Starting at 6 a.m., and running two hours each, there’s “Lies My Mother Told Me,” with a young Hayden Panettiere; “Sins of the Mother,” with Nicole Beharie and Jill Scott; and “Mom at Sixteen,” with Jane Krakowski as a perhaps overly involved health teacher. Then come the murder ones: “Like Mother, Like Daughter,” “Mommy’s Little Girl,” “The Good Mother,” “A Mother Betrayed,” “Where’s My Baby?” and finally at 10 p.m., “Mother of All Lies.”

... heartfelt British dramas: Watch “Call the Midwife.” This week’s episode is the sixth of eight in Season 5, though the beats are straightforward enough to follow even without a background in this lovely show. This particular recommendation isn’t just from me, it’s from my own mother, who gives “extra applause for the most newly born looking babies.” (Watch at 8 p.m. on PBS on Sunday.)

We had some great times, “The Good Wife.” You will be missed. But after seven terrific seasons, it’s definitely time to wrap things up. Here are some Florrick-related articles to whet your appetite:

• A conversation with the show’s star Julianna Margulies and its creators Robert and Michelle King. (The New York Times)

• More with the Kings about the mechanics of the show. (AP)

• The show’s best and worst moments, plots and episodes. (Vulture)

• An ode to Alicia Florrick. (HitFix)

• And one to Alan Cumming’s Eli Gold. (The Washington Post)

We are now more than a dozen movies into the Marvel Cinematic Universe and “Captain America: Civil War,” A.O. Scott writes, “does not in any way transcend the conventions of the genre. On the contrary: It succeeds because it doesn’t really try.” So, yes it’s familiar, but it’s also fun, though not as dire as you might think. “A more honest title would have been ‘Captain America: Collegial Misunderstanding’ or ‘Captain America: Intramural Pickup Game.’”

“Wallander” is back for a fourth and final season, with three 90-minute installments starting Sunday night. Kenneth Branagh’s beloved detective character is starting to lose his memory and is experiencing blackouts, so if you like your richly told Scandinavian detective stories with a side of “oh god, the cruel emptiness comes for us all,” you’re in luck. (Sunday, PBS, 9 p.m.; Seasons 1-3 available on Netflix)

This seminal sketch comedy series is finally on HBO. The show, created by and starring Bob Odenkirk and David Cross, is one of the most influential comedy series of the ‘90s — just about everything on Adult Swim, IFC and Comedy Central these days owes some debt to the series. Everyone has a favorite sketch, but if you’ve ever sat through the movie “Jesus Christ Superstar,” allow me to recommend the parody masterpiece “Jeepers Creepers, Semi-Star.” (Watch on HBO Go and HBO Now; the show will also be on Amazon Prime later this month.)

The current seasons of four wonderful shows are now free to download on iTunes: “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,” “Jane the Virgin,” “The Good Wife” and “Madam Secretary.” “Girlfriend” and “Jane” are two of the most inventive, original and ambitious shows in living memory, toying with form and genre in unexpected and delightful ways. We’ve already talked about “The Good Wife” a lot in this newsletter, but “Madam Secretary” never gets any love — and that’s too bad, because its second season has been a huge leap forward. The political stuff is still so-so, but the home-life stories have blossomed.

A new Radiohead album will be released on Sunday. The band dropped two music videos in advance — “Burn the Witch” and “Daydreaming.” “Daydreaming” was directed by Paul Thomas Anderson (“Boogie Nights,” “There Will Be Blood”), if that matters to you.
