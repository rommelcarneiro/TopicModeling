A film series called Fifteen by Otto Preminger pretty much has to open with “Laura,” the 1944 hit that made this director a Hollywood player. That’s just what the Museum of Modern Art does on Wednesday, May 4, when it devotes its “Modern Matinees” program to Mr. Preminger, whose films include “The Moon Is Blue,” “Exodus,” “Advise and Consent” and “Bunny Lake Is Missing” (all of which are also part of the series).

He was a relative unknown when he took on “Laura,” a murder mystery starring Gene Tierney, as producer. He ended up directing the film as well, and it became what today would be called a sleeper hit, landing him an Oscar nomination for best director. It also earned him grudging respect from Darryl F. Zanuck, the 20th Century Fox executive with whom he butted heads on the project. The first week of the MoMA series also includes “A Royal Scandal” (1945) and “Daisy Kenyon” (1947).
