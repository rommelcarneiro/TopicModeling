A Queens man was sentenced on Thursday to at least 59 years in prison in the shooting of an off-duty police officer who tried to intervene during a 2013 attack on a woman the man was stalking, prosecutors said.

The man, Jose L. Bernazard, was convicted last month in State Supreme Court in Queens of second-degree attempted murder, assault and burglary, among other charges, prosecutors said. Justice Deborah Stevens Modica sentenced him to 59 ⅓ to 66 ⅓ years in prison.

On June 16, 2013, the authorities said, Mr. Bernazard, now 42, went to the home of a woman he had dated briefly and then stalked for over a year. After the woman refused to let him in, he climbed through a window and assaulted her and her 10-year-old son, the authorities said.

The police officer, Joseph Koch, was attending a Father’s Day barbecue nearby when he heard the woman and child calling for help. Officer Koch entered the house, his badge in plain view, officials said. Mr. Bernazard grabbed Officer Koch’s gun and fired it once, shooting him in the hand and shattering the bones.

Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney, praised Officer Koch in a statement and said that “a lengthy prison term was more than warranted” for Mr. Bernazard. Mr. Bernazard’s lawyer, Russell Rothberg, declined to comment.
