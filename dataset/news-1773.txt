CBS will broadcast the Grammy Awards through at least 2026, the network announced on Wednesday.

This contract extension is for five years; CBS already had the rights to the Grammys through 2021.

The network has broadcast the Grammys since 1973, and the contract extension ensures CBS will have the show for 54 consecutive years, which CBS said was the longest continuous relationship between a single broadcaster and an awards show.

On Sunday, CBS aired the Tonys, which received a 15-year high in ratings with 8.7 million viewers. Earlier this year, the Grammys was watched by 25 million people, its lowest viewership since 2009.

Next yearâ€™s Grammys will take place on Feb. 12, 2017, returning the awards program to its traditional Sunday night slot. It was shown on Monday night this year.
