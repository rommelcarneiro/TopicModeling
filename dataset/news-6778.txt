The New York designer Harry Allen and the Portland-based Esque Studio first collaborated a decade ago, when Mr. Allen designed metal “cages” into which Andi Kovel and Justin Parker blew glass, creating curvaceous functional objects, like lamps and vases. For their latest collaboration, Mr. Allen has created geometric forms using stainless steel cut by water-jet to contain Ms. Kovel and Mr. Parker’s blown glass.

“In my head, the glass was going to be organic, drippy and droopy,” Ms. Kovel said. “But we started blowing them, and they were coming out as perfectly symmetrical spheres.”

“Harry Allen Esque” features about 25 of those pieces, most of them light sculptures that can sit on a table or hang from the ceiling. Through May 28 at Heller Gallery, 303 10th Avenue; information: 212-414-4014 or hellergallery.com.
