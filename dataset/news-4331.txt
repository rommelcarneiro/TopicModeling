“Tuck Everlasting” turns out not to be immortal.

The new musical, which began previews on March 31 and opened on April 26, will close on Sunday, the producers said. At the time of its closing, it will have played 28 previews and 39 regular performances.

The show, with music by Chris Miller, lyrics by Nathan Tysen and a book by Claudia Shear and Tim Federle, opened to mixed reviews and was nominated for only one Tony Award: best costume design, by Gregg Barnes.

The musical, directed by Casey Nicholaw, is adapted from a popular 1975 children’s book, by Natalie Babbitt, about a girl who encounters an immortal family in the woods behind her home. It never caught on with New York theatergoers: Last week, it played to 70 percent capacity audiences, and grossed $325,361, which is well below what a Broadway musical costs to run each week. The early closing means that the producers — and “Tuck” had many above-the-title producers — will lose the money they raised to mount the show.

The musical was capitalized for up to $11 million, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
