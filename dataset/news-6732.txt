For three decades, Anda Andrei helped the hotelier Ian Schrager create boutique hotels with uncommon appeal, most recently as his company’s president of design. But two and a half years ago, Ms. Andrei, 62, struck out on her own.

The first completed project of Anda Andrei Design is 11 Howard (above right), a SoHo hotel for RFR Holding that opened last month, which she designed in collaboration with the Danish firm Space Copenhagen.

“We wanted a Scandinavian feel, which is so classic and ageless,” said Ms. Andrei (above left), noting that the majority of the furniture and accessories were made from basic materials like oak, brass and linen in Copenhagen and Brooklyn. “Down to earth, but a touch glamorous.”

Next up is the Asbury, a hotel in a converted Salvation Army building in Asbury Park, N.J., set to open on Memorial Day weekend. Designed with the hotelier David Bowd as part of iStar’s redevelopment of the town’s waterfront, for which Ms. Andrei is the overall creative lead, it offers a different take on chic and simple: bright, beachy rooms with posters depicting area history and happenings glued to walls; clamp lamps; and plywood beds and bunks (top). The hope, Ms. Andrei said, is that it will appeal to both young families and young professionals and “create a new center of gravity in town.”
