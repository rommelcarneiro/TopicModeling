Shannon Leigh Mattingly, a daughter of Valeri Wiedeman Dillon and Mark L. Mattingly, both of Fremont, Calif., was married June 11 to Jon Fredericks Nathanson, a son of Teresa Fredericks Nathanson and Greg A. Nathanson of Los Angeles. David F. Nathanson, a cousin of the groom and a Universal Life minister, officiated at Calamigos Ranch, an event space in Malibu, Calif.

Mrs. Nathanson, 33, is a strategic partner manager at Facebook in Menlo Park, Calif.; she develops and manages relationships with public figures, media outlets and nonprofits. She graduated from the University of California, Berkeley.

The brideâ€™s father retired as a government and economics teacher at Mission San Jose High School in Fremont. Her mother retired last week as a special-education teacher at Village High School in Pleasanton, Calif.

Mr. Nathanson, 36, is the senior vice president for business development at Whipclip, a company in Santa Monica, Calif., that allows viewers to share snippets of television programs. He graduated from Yale and received an M.B.A. from Northwestern.

His mother is a director of and a volunteer for Project GRAD, an organization in Los Angeles that helps prepare at-risk high school students to go to college. His father retired as the president of the television station group at 20th Century Fox; he worked in Los Angeles.

The couple met in February 2015, when a mutual friend introduced the two in the hope that the bride would help the groom find a job in the San Francisco area.
